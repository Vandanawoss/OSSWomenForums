In celebration of the new arch women mailing list, I thought I'd share this bit of Erlang coding humor.  More info about the thought behind it is here.

Spelling out ERLANG with code is pretty ingenious and the comments are 
funny too.

It reminds of of the mouse's tale in chapter 3 of Alice's Adventures in 
Wonderland. The poem is a tale told by a mouse, shaped like a tail on 
the page, written in tail-rhyme structure, with each stanza shaped like 
a mouse with a tail when it's formatted normally.

Hello list,

Those of us who spend much time on #archlinux-women, and other #archlinux channels, will have encountered phrik, the archlinux bot.  

Many people are curious about him, so I thought I'd send some info to this list.  phrik is a supybot.  The Supybot handbook is at http://supybook.fealdia.org/devel/.

Hello,

I suppose people might be curious about Arch Women's other bot too. Her name is awbot. [1]

awbot is actually a collection of bots for different uses. Currently two of them are in service. One logs the channel and the other announces to -dev git commits pushed to Arch Women's server.

The bots are written in bash. There is work on a unified bot written in python. [2] The python bot will do generic announcements of any event, not just git pushes. We might need a generic announcement bot soon, before the python bot is finished. In that situation we may use irkerd. [3]

Hi,

Tags are used to organize to-do pages on the wiki. The current tags[1] are 
a little confusing. I would like to rename two of them.

todo -> open
"todo" identifies open tasks. It would be clearer to just call it "open".

todo_issue -> todo
"todo_issue" identifies to-do pages. If "todo" gets renamed, this should 
be renamed to "todo".

Also, I want to add a new tag:

  important

This tag will identify tasks which are deemed important. What it says on 
the tin. :-)

What do you folks think?

Hello,

In past meetings people have emphasized the importance of having 
pages for newcomers, outside observers and potential sponsors. 
We also need to keep internal notes for people working on the 
projects. Keeping these notes on the same pages intended for 
newcomers would only confuse newcomers and would clutter the 
notes intended for project participants.

I propose a project start page should give an overview. It is 
for people not familiar with the project to learn what it is 
about and how to participate. Internal administrative notes 
should be on a separate admin page.

:start - describe the project, history, how it helps further
         aw's goals, how to participate
:admin - administrative page, to-do list, notes on procedures
         and common periodic tasks

classroom:start would be moved to classroom:admin.
mentorship:start and internships:start would stay where they are.
mentorship:admin and internships:admin would be created new.

How does that sound?

Hi all,

Here are some thoughts about mentorship, mostly taken from the discussion at the March, 2015 Arch Women meeting.  There was to have been a small group meeting on IRC in March, but it was difficult to coordinate a time when everyone could be there.  So it's happening here on the mailing list instead.


 * Notes/ideas for the Arch Linux Women Mentorship Discussion * 

People who expressed an interest in participating:  meskarune, you, me, jy2wong, and alad.  CalimeroTeknik, nisstyre, AndreeeCZ and yuvadm have put themselves on the list as willing to be mentors.  They may want to come.  And anyone else who wants to come.

Group will discuss and bring this to regular Arch Linux Women meeting in June.  fsckd drafted some criteria/suggestions for the group to consider. Those are below.  

The mentorship list now:  https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:mentorship:offers

Also, 
   Mentors, mentees, manatees  http://im.skdat.com/data/gallery/21/manatee.jpg 


=== General - clarify what we really mean by mentorship

Topics - Scope:
  * what should be the scope of the topics allowed?
  * Should they be limited to those usable for Arch?

Formality:
  * How formal do we want this (program?) to be?

Commitment:
  * what is the amount of time / level of commitment expected/required?
    * For both mentors and mentees?

Topics - Ideas:
    * IDEA: There are quite a few facets to arch, from bugtracking to packaging and documentation, so that's a good topic for mentorship
    * IDEA: Allan indicated he might be willing to mentor someone about the toolchain.  Needs more info

Process:
  * How would this work in general?
    * How do potential mentors communicate their areas of expertise?
    * How do potential mentees communicate their area of interest?
    * How do we connect the two?
  * fsckd's thoughts and suggestions below


=== Privacy
"While I'm happy to mentor, I'm not sure I'm happy having my name up on a...err, shit magnet page. I really have no desire to have internet poo flung at me by random strangers who decide the arch women mentorship program is lulzy."

Privacy - General
    General ideas/suggestions/considerations and blocks
- The list on the wiki now has the problem of zero privacy for mentors.  The internet can be a scary place.
  * How do we protect the privacy of mentors and mentees while keeping the process easy to use and accessible?
  * Consider the specific attacks we're trying to defend against, and find possible solutions.

Privacy - Technical
    Technical suggestions and ideas.
  * Using the Arch Women Wiki - make use of dokuwiki's ACLs to create a special mentor group that can see the list of mentors
  * People not in that group would be able to see the topics but not the names of the mentors. (names would be anonymized)
  * Using the Arch Women Wiki - some other docuwiki feature
  * Use something completely different


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~ fsckd's criteria/suggestions from the March General Arch Women meeting.  I put them here because they are a good beginning for discussion.  

General
- fsckd's suggestion on the general process:
  * The process of connecting mentors with mentees should not be convoluted or tedious.

Privacy
- fsckd's suggestions on privacy:
  * Mentors should retain their privacy. The list of mentors should be neither public nor anonymously accessible.
  * Mentees should retain their privacy. There is no public list of mentees.
  * People should easily be able to add themselves to the list of mentors, remove themselves from the list of mentors, and temporarily take a break from the mentorship program.
  * Accessible to people not familiar with IRC.
  * Skills should be publicly viewable even though list of mentors is not.
    * &lt;alad&gt; so in short, a "private" mentor list, where people can easily add themselves to, and that can be queried by topic?

Hi,

I couldn't attend the May meeting due to irregular college hours, but 
I've read the logs and saw the possible license of classrooms was 
discussed. I'm attaching a mail from Kynikos confirming how projects 
collaborating with ArchWiki should indeed keep the same license (as the 
GNU Documentation License 1.3 describes).

The GDL isn't flawless, but it's well established and I think the 
required logging of changes and attribution of content speak for itself. 
"Invariant sections" can be added on-demand, but are by no means 
mandatory. [1]

I also believe Kynikos makes a fair point on how both wiki and classroom 
projects could share efforts (and he did show his enthusiasm towards 
Classroom in a later email). Particularly in cases when time is too 
short to prepare a full class, and to reach more people interested in 
Arch Linux topics.

Regards,

Alad

Um... I'll start saying I've always hated all this legal stuff :P When I 
joined the ArchWiki, it was already under the GFDL, and according to the 
small research that I published in [1], it has always been since its 
creation, in fact creating [2] has been the absolutely first edit of 
all.

I don't know "why" that license was chosen over others, but relicensing 
everything doesn't sound anything feasible to me, so if Arch Classroom 
has to be hosted in the wiki, it has to bear the same license full stop. 
In theory a fully compatible license could be used too, but the license 
statement in the footer of the articles would stay as GFDL, so this 
doesn't seem a viable option either.

Besides, if the Arch Classroom is hosted in the wiki, it's part of it as 
a subproject, and cannot be considered as a separate project, so it must 
abide to all the wiki regulations, in addition to the license. I'm 
referring in particular to duplication of content, which is something 
that the classroom articles generated copiously in the past and that the 
wiki staff had to fix, still with some remainders, e.g. [3]. If some 
wiki articles are not clear, effort should be spent in improving them, 
not in creating "better" alternative articles.

Coming back to the license, it's not very clear to me what's your degree 
of involvement with the Classroom project, but are you aware of a 
particular reason why the use of GFDL is questioned? If not, we could 
all just keep it simple and use our energies to contribute content to 
the wiki as we've always done, regardless of the license ;)

Thanks, this is a good point. I think GDL may very well be the way to go for Arch Classroom classes. We can combine efforts with the Arch Wiki and of course make sure that information is free for others to use.

Classroom in a later email). Particularly in cases when time is too 
short to prepare a full class, and to reach more people interested in 
Arch Linux topics.

Um... I'll start saying I've always hated all this legal stuff :P When I 
joined the ArchWiki, it was already under the GFDL, and according to the 
small research that I published in [1], it has always been since its 
creation, in fact creating [2] has been the absolutely first edit of 
all. 
 
I don't know "why" that license was chosen over others, but relicensing 
everything doesn't sound anything feasible to me, so if Arch Classroom 
has to be hosted in the wiki, it has to bear the same license full stop. 
In theory a fully compatible license could be used too, but the license 
statement in the footer of the articles would stay as GFDL, so this 
doesn't seem a viable option either. 
 
Besides, if the Arch Classroom is hosted in the wiki, it's part of it as 
a subproject, and cannot be considered as a separate project, so it must 
abide to all the wiki regulations, in addition to the license. I'm 
referring in particular to duplication of content, which is something 
that the classroom articles generated copiously in the past and that the 
wiki staff had to fix, still with some remainders, e.g. [3]. If some 
wiki articles are not clear, effort should be spent in improving them, 
not in creating "better" alternative articles. 
 
Coming back to the license, it's not very clear to me what's your degree 
of involvement with the Classroom project, but are you aware of a 
particular reason why the use of GFDL is questioned? If not, we could 
all just keep it simple and use our energies to contribute content to 
the wiki as we've always done, regardless of the license ;)

I think we could make pages on the wiki private with people in the mentor group having access. The public page could list information like how to get a mentor and what sorts of things people can get help with. I would be willing to be a publicly known coordinator/contact and maybe we can create an email "mentoring@archwomen.org" for people to contact as well.

Hi all,

Here are some thoughts about mentorship, mostly taken from the discussion at the March, 2015 Arch Women meeting.  There was to have been a small group meeting on IRC in March, but it was difficult to coordinate a time when everyone could be there.  So it's happening here on the mailing list instead.


 * Notes/ideas for the Arch Linux Women Mentorship Discussion * 

People who expressed an interest in participating:  meskarune, you, me, jy2wong, and alad.  CalimeroTeknik, nisstyre, AndreeeCZ and yuvadm have put themselves on the list as willing to be mentors.  They may want to come.  And anyone else who wants to come.

Group will discuss and bring this to regular Arch Linux Women meeting in June.  fsckd drafted some criteria/suggestions for the group to consider. Those are below.  

The mentorship list now:  https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:mentorship:offers

Also, 
   Mentors, mentees, manatees  http://im.skdat.com/data/gallery/21/manatee.jpg 


=== General - clarify what we really mean by mentorship

Topics - Scope:
  * what should be the scope of the topics allowed?
  * Should they be limited to those usable for Arch?

Formality:
  * How formal do we want this (program?) to be?

Commitment:
  * what is the amount of time / level of commitment expected/required?
    * For both mentors and mentees?

Topics - Ideas:
    * IDEA: There are quite a few facets to arch, from bugtracking to packaging and documentation, so that's a good topic for mentorship
    * IDEA: Allan indicated he might be willing to mentor someone about the toolchain.  Needs more info

Process:
  * How would this work in general?
    * How do potential mentors communicate their areas of expertise?
    * How do potential mentees communicate their area of interest?
    * How do we connect the two?
  * fsckd's thoughts and suggestions below


=== Privacy
"While I'm happy to mentor, I'm not sure I'm happy having my name up on a...err, shit magnet page. I really have no desire to have internet poo flung at me by random strangers who decide the arch women mentorship program is lulzy."

Privacy - General
    General ideas/suggestions/considerations and blocks
- The list on the wiki now has the problem of zero privacy for mentors.  The internet can be a scary place.
  * How do we protect the privacy of mentors and mentees while keeping the process easy to use and accessible?
  * Consider the specific attacks we're trying to defend against, and find possible solutions.

Privacy - Technical
    Technical suggestions and ideas.
  * Using the Arch Women Wiki - make use of dokuwiki's ACLs to create a special mentor group that can see the list of mentors
  * People not in that group would be able to see the topics but not the names of the mentors. (names would be anonymized)
  * Using the Arch Women Wiki - some other docuwiki feature
  * Use something completely different


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~ fsckd's criteria/suggestions from the March General Arch Women meeting.  I put them here because they are a good beginning for discussion.  

General
- fsckd's suggestion on the general process:
  * The process of connecting mentors with mentees should not be convoluted or tedious.

Privacy
- fsckd's suggestions on privacy:
  * Mentors should retain their privacy. The list of mentors should be neither public nor anonymously accessible.
  * Mentees should retain their privacy. There is no public list of mentees.
  * People should easily be able to add themselves to the list of mentors, remove themselves from the list of mentors, and temporarily take a break from the mentorship program.
  * Accessible to people not familiar with IRC.
  * Skills should be publicly viewable even though list of mentors is not.
    * &lt;alad&gt; so in short, a "private" mentor list, where people can easily add themselves to, and that can be queried by topic?

I think this is a good idea. We could have "open", "closed" "wontfix" and "important" tags to help organize todo items.

Ok, done. Here are the changes I made.

New tags:
important - If a task has higher importance than normal. Close these as soon as possible.
critical - A task which must be completed immediately. If you tag something as critical, please let us know on IRC.

Renamed tags:
todo_issue -> todo
todo -> open
closed -> wontfix

The tag "wontfix" sounds a little harsh but I think it is clearer than "closed". Temper with a good description why a task won't be completed.

We should find or make a script to rename tags. It is not fun to do it manually.

Hi,

I'm copying an email sent to the arch-general mailing list earlier today:

Hello,

The class "An Imperfect Introduction to Static Typing" is rescheduled to Sunday, May 17th at 23:00 UTC. HalosGhost is in the middle of moving and will not have internet at home at the original time. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope you will still be able to attend. Thank you for understanding.

This will be going on the arch women blog shortly, but I thought I'd post it to this list as well:

Some Links Related to Women In Computing, June, 2015
====================================================

Here are a couple of links related to women in computing that have been posted in #archlinux-women in the last few days.

It turns out Grace Hopper was not the only woman to create a programming language.  Who knew?  [9 programming languages and the women who created them](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2920542/app-development/9-programming-languages-and-the-women-who-created-them.html), Computerworld, May 18, 2015.
 
Intel has created a venture capital fund aimed at increasing the number of women- and minority-led technology startups.  [Intel creates $125 million fund for tech firms led by women and minorities](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/06/intel-creates-125-million-fund-for-tech-firms-led-by-women-and-minorities/), Ars Technica, June 10, 2015

Hello list,

Arch Women needs someone who likes to write.  You may have noticed a lack of activity on our blog and on this list.  It's because we're not writers.  Things like blog posts and emails to the arch women list with links of interest to women in tech, and announcements of classes and such would be awesome.  Twitter, same thing.  You don't need to be "technical" to participate in Open Source [1].

If you're an Arch user who is interested in encouraging women to use Arch Linux, this is a great way to participate.

Hi,

I working with Video4Linux and ImageSensor.  Some drivers I create on 3.8
kernel on Fedora OS know I want to compile on 4.2 kernel.  I have problem
with v4l2_subdev_video_ops  -> enum_frameintervals, try_mbus_fmt ,
s_mbus_fmt  and v4l2_ioctl_ops -> g_chip_ident  because I don't have it in
 kernel 4.2  and I don't know which ops will be good replacement.
Best regards,

Anteja

I see on the Arch wiki [1] that there's been a class requested on bash
scripting and coreutils basics. I'd be comfortable putting one together
either on my own or with a co-presenter, if there's still any interest
in such a thing.

Hi,

I am unsure if I can be around for the next meeting.
In addition to other issues and things which keep me busy, I have not
written that much or productive.

On public relations, so far I contacted one person who's giving Linux
courses / lessons. They subscribed to this list and also said it's a
nice project and they will point people to / tell them about it next time.

On what I collected so far, this is all I got, I hope some of it can be
helpful.
In addition to the mentioned notes, I will setup an general and maybe an
tech related things channel for lgbtiq* community on psyced.org soon to
test if people start using it more.

  - use of liquid democracy tools like Adhocracy_ and LiquidFeedback_

  - PSYC channel instead of (or an addition to) freenode IRC.
    If you have questions on PSYC, feel free to ask me.
    In my opinion from usage, there's not a huge learning curve and it
has support for multicast, meaning you can use irc, xmpp, psyc clients
to communicate.

So additional info, even if I can make it to the meeting it's much text,
coming from a conversation this with lynX:

PSYC (psyced.org) features useful for this project:
- has scalable banlists
- you technically can't send private messages to strangers: you first
need to friendship each other, before that every user has a default
filter where strangers can't stalk them or harass them via priv msg.
- you can set requirements for joining users like "registered" and
"encrypted"
-- however, if somebody automates the registering process there are no
tools to handle this yet (also see below) but can/will be written then.
in a sense if a massive 4chan attack (or even small regular attacks)
happen it would be more than a stress test
- you can have a 2 step system (ask lynX about that one):
-- example:
   new user joins, gets into archwomen-welcome. when they are no
   spammer or otherwise toxic person they get invited into archwomen
   (which could be invite only, invisible from listing).
   in the long run, this could be too annoying for 4chan.

If problems occur, it's a challenge to accept and tune psycd, as long as
it can improve psycd it's good for all who use psyc. On the other hand -
if problems hit an problematic point (more work than people can handle)
there are features which are restricted to psyc admins - run your own
instance -, like only admins see IP numbers of users, nobody else. so
you can block the IP numbers (did lynX mean block in iptables or in
psyc? i don't know anymore, contact him if you need to know) of spammers.


Although I grew tired of IRC, I will try to make it to the next meeting.

I was at a talk yesterday, so I couldn't make it.
Additional notes after reading the log:

If I get the signal today from a friend, I have to write an easy
accessible how-to guide for xmpp,irc,telnet,etc software for PSYC.

I am sure this will be easy to adapt for the wiki, and more understandable.
There's more to be gained other than connection with more clients.
As I don't use anything other than IRC clients now, but I will fill the
wiki of the other project with notes for common mobile and desktop clients.

Hello,

December's meeting will be this Sunday, the 6th, at 16:00 UTC. As the 
switch from DST was recent, some might not know the correct time. You 
can get the correct time for your timezone using the date command: 
date -d '2015-12-06 16:00 UTC'

Meetings are held in the IRC channel #archlinux-women on the freenode 
network. A tentative agenda for the December meeting is available on 
Arch Women's wiki. [1] If you wish to add to the agenda, feel free to 
edit the wiki in the days before the meeting, or leave a note on this 
list or in the IRC channel. Thanks and hope to see you there!

We need to discuss and plan "the great wiki cleanup". Our wiki is sorta 
all over the place and it should be a bit more organized. Pages need to 
be marked as stubs placed into the right name spaces. I thought I'd get 
the ball rolling with planning on the mailing list. :)

I haven't been around for some time, was there a decision on namespaces?
If knowing the desired new structure would help in fixing and marking,
it would be good to add this to the thread too.

Alright, I guess I have found the new structure, somehow..
is it the WIP at https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:start ?

That was just one proposal for organizing projects. That is still in 
discussion. The wiki namespace structure is a different topic and can 
be seen here:
https://archwomen.org/wiki/start?do=index

The purpose of this wiki project is to improve navigation. Namespaces 
are part of the discussion. Other means of navigation should also be 
considered, such as tags, lists, summary pages, and so on.

We had a joint meeting on #archlinux-women yesterday and did discuss a
few plans.

But we really need to plan more sustainable models in the face of
competing projects and address gaps in our targeting.

fine, we can have a Fedora Women's Day.

The situation is like lot of women are interested in learning,
projects, internships, certificates, ...

There are a few initiatives with limited uptake like the well known
ones, GSOC ,systers-related,  etc and so we need to offer more.

Hello,

As decided in the May meeting[1] there is going be a wiki cleanup this 
Saturday, May 21st, and again one week later on Saturday, May 28th.

The idea is to find pages which need to be moved, merged, tagged, expanded, 
edited, or whatever and then do those things. We will also improve the 
navigation of the wiki by adding links to :start pages and making indexes. 
This is a great time to start work on hellerbarde's project[2].

I started documenting wiki conventions[3]. As of this writing it is 
nowhere near finished. Hopefully enough will be done by Saturday to serve 
as a rough guide of what is expected on the wiki. As always, please point 
out the unclear parts.

Hope to see you all there and thanks for your help!

fsckd

I'd like to discuss the idea of having a jobs board. The board would
list jobs from women friendly tech companies and generate a little cash
for Arch Women. The free software foundation has something similar as an
example: https://www.fsf.org/resources/jobs

I'd like to hear people's thoughts on the pros and cons for this, if its
something we should look into doing and how it should be done if we
decide to go that route.

I want to make sure we are vetting any companies that contact us so only
high quality postings from good places are posted. Maybe with some
criteria like having anti-harassment policies and being LGBTQ friendly.

I think this would be an awesome idea and resource for the community. :)
My experience planning and mapping out something like this is minimal,
but I'd be happy to support it any way I can.

Are there any other communities similar to Arch Women with something
like this that we could maybe refer to as an example?

Just chipping in to say InHerSight is a good starting resource regarding
company vetting - it ranks companies according to a variety of metrics
including equal opportunities for men and women and learning opportunities.
There are also company reviews which tend to focus on workplace conditions,
etc.

The main downsides of using the site are that some smaller companies may
not be included and it has an American slant.

Dear Arch Linux community,

Although this is not generally ideal place to ask, I wanted diverse opinion
on this subject. including mixed genders.

Hello, my name is Irvin Choi I am student from Dwight School Seoul, and I
am writing a extended essay within IB (ibo.org) curriculum research paper
about systemd, service manager for Linux/GNU operating system. There are
few questions that I would like to ask to broaden my understanding
regarding systemd, and I would like to kindly ask you to answer them to
best of your ability.

It is very important for my research paper, as the research paper plays
huge role in my high school curriculum and possibly my future. I would like
to mention that, I may use your questions on the research paper for
credibility purposes.

Here are the questions (please consider explaining your answers and avoid
short answers):

1) Who are you and what do you do for the community?

2) What do you think of the systemd as a service manager? Do you have an
opinion about its pros and cons?

3) What do you think users of the distribution thinks about the systemd? Do
you think they favor systemd? If not, why so?

4) Through my research, I was able to see that there are existing service
managers such as upstart, sysvinit, and others. Why did systemd become the
standard over the others in most of the distributions? Was it worth the
replacement of existing service manager that is seen to be reliable?

5) What changes that do you think systemd should make to improve itself?
For instance, =E2=80=98typing systemctl everytime is bothersome. Systemd sh=
ould
shorten it to sctl instead.)

6) There are lots of Linux/GNU users across the world. To what users are
systemd intended for? Do you think systemd is useful for the servers
administrators, desktop users, laptop users, or others?

7) I=E2=80=99ve heard that there are lots of debate about systemd and it re=
ally got
heated at one point, involving personal opinions, politics, and others.
What was the cause and how did it get resolved (if at all)?

8) Is there anything else you would like to tell me about systemd?

Thank you very much time.. It means a lot for me, as I am really interested
in Linux/GNU system, and this became the opportunity to broaden my
understanding.

Have a great day.

You must do more background study for your study/survey.
See LWN ( lwn.net ) for many discussions on systemd, its merits and demerits.
Try and form your questionnaire from that

On a technical topic like this your questions should encourage short answers.

Today I'm announcing pragmatique, a new project.

Its primary focus is to open up the efforts I've been working on for
some time to other people, to provide space as a community, and to work
on more than just software.

Our main project is pragmaOS, an on-going project to build a live-system
for applications around GNUnet and further software solutions which make
use of GNUnet, based on GuixSD.

We are currently setting up our new development server, so there's no
immediate fancy environment to sign up at and start hacking.

Our software page shows an early road map without the targeted versions.

You can read more about our project at 
https://pragmatique.xyz/ - be aware that this
is an early version of the web site.

Let me know what you think and join the fun!

Hey everyone,

I wanted to challenge everyone in the Arch Linux Women community to join
me next week in the #HappinessPacketChallenge!

    https://blog.justinwflory.com/2017/04/happiness-packets-challenge/

Happiness Packets are like thank-you cards for open source users or
contributors. You can send a packet to anyone for anything. Your message
can be as short or as long as you like. You can put your name on your
message or you can keep it totally anonymous.

So, what is the #HappinessPacketChallenge? I challenge you to do the
following: write at least one Happiness Packet (or more!) every day for
one week. At a minimum, this is only seven times where you say =E2=80=9Ct=
hank
you=E2=80=9D to someone else in open source. Of course, you can send more=
 if you
want to.

You can find more details in the blog post linked above. I hope everyone
will help spread some positivity through the open source community next
week!

Justin W. Flory

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share a helpful resource with the community about a great
way to use IRC. For anyone familiar with IRC, we know its strengths and
also its weaknesses, especially for people who are just getting involved
with open source for the first time. Over the past year, a new protocol
called Matrix has been developed with a front-end client called Riot. It
integrates easily with various IRC networks, offering a bouncer-like
service and a friendly, easy-to-use interface for various platforms.

You can check out more about Riot and see how to use it in the following
article on Opensource.com:

    https://opensource.com/article/17/5/introducing-riot-IRC

Hope some people find this useful! Thought I would share it. :) Even if
you're already using your own IRC setup, the work going on with Matrix /
Riot is still cool to read about. :) Feel free to share this with anyone
who might find it useful too.

We are trying to plan out a real world meetup in California, around the
silicon valley area or San Francisco. I need to know how many people are
interested in going, what sort of food you like, and what kind of
talks/events you'd be interested in. Lets see what we can do for the
very first arch women meetup. :D

helpful place to document and keep track of this info too. :)

                          an advocacy organization, EFF is committed to
                          being part of a diverse community. Diversity
                          of life experiences makes a big difference in
                          how we identify and litigate legal issues,

                          deliberately seek applicants with different

                          build a diverse and inclusive workplace to

Hi all,

I saw this message on another list and thought it was helpful. Since I
know many in the open source community are following this closely, I
thought the below advice was helpful.

Howdy, FOSSers!

The FCC passed the Restoring Internet Freedom proposal, which *repeals*
net neutrality rules in a 3-2 vote, to nobody's great surprise.

While the result is disappointing, this is not where net neutrality
ends! We need to make a lot of noise and support organizations that are
fighting on our behalf. Some 80+% of people support net neutrality so
know that popular opinion is on our side.

Where we go from here is uncertain but it's not over. Fights for net
neutrality are already gearing up and lawsuits are being filed. The New
York Attorney General announced he will sue the FCC, and other
organizations will likely follow suit.
*
*
*Here's how you can help:*
Visit https://www.battleforthenet.com/. They're still in the fight, and
they're now gathering support for Congress to overrule the FCC.

Consider donating to the ACLU, EFF, FreePress, and other pro net
neutrality organizations.

Write to your government reps about net neutrality (this site helps!
https://www.mailmygov.com/) - even if they're on your side. Use
ResistBot (text 50409) to fax them. Make sure to make an informed vote
in your next election. Don't forget about your local officials!

If you have a municipal network, independent ISP, or mesh network in
your community (or infrastructure that could support one of those), help
fight for it in your community and get involved if possible.

Make noise! Don't stop talking about net neutrality online and off. Join
protests if there's one local to you. The worst thing we can do now is
be quiet. We need to make sure that nobody forgets and our elected
officials can't ignore us.



*Do it for the Internet we know and love.*

Hi Arch Women ,

Someone in the Fedora women's list suggested I reach out.

My name is Emma, and I work on Diversity and Inclusion at Mozilla.  Last
year we invested in a lot of research to better understand
<https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/a-time-for-action-innovating-for-diversity-inclusion-in-open-source-communities-6922fef4675e>
what we mean by diversity and inclusion, with a number of recommendations
coming out of that.  Two of those recommendations were to build metrics
that matter,
<https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/reflection-inclusive-organizing-for-open-source-communities-9c44f0b689c1>
and to invest in ways of collaborating with other individuals and open
projects  - to really generate change.

To those goals I want to ask *if you would be wiling to share our survey
<https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/diversity-inclusion-in-open-source-survey/23733>
*with your community, and whether anyone representing this group would be
available for an interview with our researcher - who is looking into how we
might form a collaborative for D&I in open source.

Thanks for your time, and of course happy to take questions or provide more
information on our work! 2018 for sure is all about taking our research,
and driving real change this year - would love to learn from you as well!

-Emma

Hello again,

On February 28th, we're hosting our first 'D&I in Open Source Community
Call'
<https://medium.com/@sunnydeveloper/new-diversity-inclusion-in-open-source-community-call-52d01324e0a9>,
where we will share the survey results (will also post a blog shortly
after), including what we learned building it.  The call itself we hope to
run every 3 weeks, to encourage cross-project collaboration - I'm also
going to look at adding value like expert speakers to the call  - but the
first one is to get a sense of what would be valuable for others.  Would
love to see someone from your group attend!

Thanks,

-Emma

 The Free Software Foundation's LibrePlanet 2018 conference, coming up at
MIT in
Cambridge, MA on March 24-25.

_____________________FWD__________

LibrePlanet is an annual conference for free software enthusiasts,
bringing together software developers, policy experts, activists and
computer users to learn skills, share accomplishments, and face
challenges to software freedom. Newcomers are always welcome, and
LibrePlanet 2018 will feature programming for all ages and experience
levels. FSF members and students attend gratis. Learn more at
https://libreplanet.org/2018; register at
https://my.fsf.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=71.

LibrePlanet's 10th anniversary theme is "Freedom. Embedded." Consider:
embedded systems are everywhere, in cars, digital watches, traffic
lights, and even within our bodies. Right now, proprietary software is
everywhere, its sinister aspects embedded in software, digital devices,
and our lives. We've come to expect that our phones monitor our activity
and share that data with big companies, governments enforce digital
restrictions management (DRM), and even our activity on social Web sites
is out of our control.

In a society reliant on embedded systems, how do we defend computer user
freedom? How do we insist on copylefted code, protect ourselves against
government and corporate surveillance, and move toward a freer world?
For many people, digital freedom seems like a pipe dream. Can we change
the narrative and make free software the norm, instead of walled
gardens, denial of the right to repair, and DRM?

Let's envision freedom embedded together.

<br>LibrePlanet&#39;s 10th anniversary theme is &quot;Freedom. Embedded.&qu=
ot; Consider:<br>embedded systems are everywhere, in cars, digital watches,=
 traffic<br>lights, and even within our bodies. Right now, proprietary soft=
ware is<br>everywhere, its sinister aspects embedded in software, digital d=
evices,<br>and our lives. We&#39;ve come to expect that our phones monitor =
our activity<br>and share that data with big companies, governments enforce=
 digital<br>restrictions management (DRM), and even our activity on social =
Web sites<br>is out of our control.<br>
<br>In a society reliant on embedded systems, how do we defend computer use=
r<br>freedom? How do we insist on copylefted code, protect ourselves agains=
t<br>government and corporate surveillance, and move toward a freer world?<=
br>For many people, digital freedom seems like a pipe dream. Can we change<=
br>the narrative and make free software the norm, instead of walled<br>gard=
ens, denial of the right to repair, and DRM?<br>
<br>Let&#39;s envision freedom embedded together.<br><br>__________________=
