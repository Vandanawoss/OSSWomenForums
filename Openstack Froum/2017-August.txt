Hello everyone

I am Poonam, a third year undergraduate studying at BITS Pilani, India. I
am completely new to the concept of Openstack and I find it extremely
fascinating. I want to learn about the projects and how to get involved.

My previous work involved a lot of backend development in Django and Flask.
I have made many softwares and games for my college fests and events. I am
also selected for Google Summer of Code student under Systers this year for
the project Automated Testing. Along with that, I have an experience in C++
and Python for more than 2 years as of now. I even went to the regionals of
ACM-ICPC.

It would be great if someone could guide me with how I can start
contributing to Openstack. Thanks in advance!



Regards,
Poonam Mishra

Hello All!

We are excited to kick off the next round of mentoring sponsored by the
Women of OpenStack! Anyone can sign up who is interested in mentoring or in
need of a mentor!

Mentors! We can set you up as a technical mentor based on your areas of
expertise within the community or we can match you with a mentee looking
for more career advice.

Mentees! We have a variety of Stackers interested in giving you both
technical and career advice! We have mentors from a wide range of projects
and working groups willing to help you get involved in different aspects of
the community.

We would like to make as many matches before the Denver PTG as we can
so you can meet with your mentee/mentor there if you are both attending.



  If you have been involved with previous rounds of mentoring, we would
  love
  to have you back!  Please fill out the form below, since we are starting
  from a clean slate on mentors and mentees this time.

  Sign up to get involved here:

Hello everyone :)

I just wondered who might be attending the PTG? I thought it might be fun
to collect somewhere for a happy hour and get to know one another better
maybe? Reply here if you are going to be there and if you will be there for
the whole week or just a subset of the days?

I will be there all the days :) I get in the weekend before and fly out on
Friday.

Just some word massaging to the first paragraph for readability. I know lots of people put great thought into this and these are always so tricky to write, so see what you all think! 


The Women of OpenStack (WOO) strive to increase the diversity of the OpenStack community by overcoming OpenStack's barrier to entry through educational sessions, professional networking, mentorship, social inclusion, and enhanced resource access. WOO recognizes that individuals in minority groups are more likely to have challenges accessing the resources it takes to learn and participate in complex technologies, which is why WOO welcomes all women and their allies who share an interest in OpenStack, open source, and adjacent technologies.

I think Anne's changes sound good to me! If everyone else likes that too we
should update it on the wiki.

I would rephrase what comes after the mission to:

'We follow this mission by hosting Speed Mentoring and Lunch and Learns at
the summits, and coordinating ongoing mentoring throughout the year as well
as other activities.'

See what you all think :)

Thanks Amy for getting the ball rolling!

I'm good with both suggestions and if everyone is good with the re-write of
the mission statement we should definitely update the wiki as well.

I'm good with both suggestions and if everyone is good with the re-write of
the mission statement we should definitely update the wiki as well.

  See what you all think :)

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Let's talk Edge Computing at OpenDev,
	next week in San Francisco
Message-ID: <DD4085C3-DCDC-4566-B2CE-A15E600E1D0B@openstack.org>

Interested in Edge Computing? *Next week* join us for OpenDev <http://www.opendevconf.com/>, a collaborative working event at DogPatch Studios in San Francisco, September 7-8. 

Register here <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/opendev-2017-edge-computing-tickets-35579171259>. Tickets are just $100 for the two-day event. 

OpenDev will feature Edge use case demos from Verizon, AT&T and eBay in addition to updates from industry pioneers including Satya <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/bio.html> from Carnegie Mellon who’s doing cutting “edge” research. Participating groups include OpenStack, Open Edge Computing, ETSI MEC, OPNFV, Kubernetes and others. 

Program committee includes Beth Cohen (Verizon) Kandan Kathirvel (AT&T), Chris Price (Ericsson), Andrew Mitry (Walmart) and Gregory Katsaros (Inmarsat). 

As cloud architectures continue to evolve, compute is being pushed to the Edge in telecom, retail, research and other industries. This represents a huge opportunity for open infrastructure, so we’re meeting to talk about how to assemble and integrate the components needed to meet Edge requirements.

The event is designed to facilitate collaboration at a technical level with productive, working group discussions, in addition to lightning talk presentations on Edge use cases. There will be a range of working sessions led by moderators who dive into specific topics. Topics like managing security, what control planes need to look like, networking technologies in play, deployment considerations, zero touch provisioning and others. The discussions will be technical and specific—this is not meant to be a vision or thought leadership event, but a practical step forward in improving the state of Edge across open tech. View the schedule line-up here <http://www.opendevconf.com/schedule/>. 

This important event is proudly sponsored by Intel, Ericsson and OpenStack Foundation.

Questions? Contact events at openstack.org <mailto:events at openstack.org>.

Hello Everyone :)

So. I have done some research and I am kind of waffling.  Wednesday at 5:00
is time and date. The location is the tricky part.

There is a brewery a block away- Station 26- but it looks like they only
have beer, not sure how people feel about that.

There is a good happy hour place with all the options- Bar Louie- a ten min
car ride away if people are okay with lyft/uber.

OR, there is the hotel bar which I am told is pretty good, but I imagine we
will all be spending a lot of time in so I thought going somewhere else for
variety's sake might be good.

I don't know. What do you all think?

I just wondered who might be attending the PTG? I thought it might be fun to collect somewhere for a happy hour and get to know one another better maybe? Reply here if you are going to be there and if you will be there for the whole week or just a subset of the days?
I will be there all the days :) I get in the weekend before and fly out on Friday.

Greetings!

I really have no preference, especially after checking a map. Bar
Louie is a chain and I've found one of their other locations to be
extremely loud. Caseys could work just fine as well. I'll be in the
area this coming Sunday, so I'm more than happy to go checkout
locations in person before PTG.

@Julia OOooOO if you want to scope things out that would be awesome.

I definitely agree Bar Louie can be loud- I also tend to try to stay away
from chains, just threw it out there as an option.

I'll go ahead and scope it out, but walking to the pub does sound like the
best idea :)
