Hi there,

If you?re planning to attend the Summit in Vancouver, May 18-22, then please SAVE THE DATE for the following Women of OpenStack events!

More details and RSVP links coming soon.

Cheers,
Claire


SUNDAY
Women of OpenStack Networking Event sponsored by Intel and IBM
You won?t want to miss this two-part event! RSVP links and more detailed will be shared soon. Space is limited so an RSVP will be required!

Yacht Cruise, 3:00 - 6:00pm
Part One: We will board a chartered yacht <http://www.sunsetbaycharters.net/yacht/> and slowly cruise around the perimeter of Vancouver from 3:00 - 6:00pm. The city and mountains views are spectacular from the water! Beverages and snacks will be provided.

Happy Hour, 6:00 - 7:30pm
Part Two: Following the boat cruise we will head to The Roof <http://the-roof.ca/#/34-2/>, a nearby venue, for Happy Hour and hors d?oeuvres from 6:00 - 7:30pm. Transportation will be provided from the boat dock to The Roof venue. Folks who are unable to arrive in time to partake in the boat ride are encouraged to attend the Happy Hour. The Roof venue is a 10-minute walk from the Convention Centre and surrounding Summit hotels. More details will be shared soon. 

MONDAY
Ally Skills Workshop <https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-training/> lead by the Ada Initiative - Sponsored by the Women of OpenStack, 2:00-6:00pm
A workshop designed to teach men simple, everyday ways to support women in their workplaces and communities. This event is geared towards men participants and has a very limited capacity so there will be an application. Details will be announced soon. Please encourage your male colleagues to participate!

TUESDAY
Breakfast Working Session, 7:00-8:45am
There will again be a working breakfast session for the Women of OpenStack on Tuesday morning before keynotes. Details coming soon!

Session: Standing Tall in the Room <https://openstacksummitmay2015vancouver.sched.org/event/b284b605b47b6652358b8ac650366eca#.VSbb1VzyS5I>, 2:00-2:40pm
Room 110
Join this panel of empowered women as we cover some of the tips and tricks for getting heard in an environment filled with many egos and opinions. Presenters: Beth Cohen, Nalee Jang, Liz Joseph, Rainya Mosher, Radha Ratnaparkhi, Shilla Saebi and Alexandra Settle. 

Tech Talk Presentations, 11:00am - 6pm
Room 106
SUBMIT TALKS HERE! <http://openstack.prov12n.com/vbrownbag-techtalks-in-vancouver/> The #vBrownBag Tech Talks are brief 10-minute talks presented to a very small audience (less than 20 people). The talks are livestreamed, video recorded and posted online within 24 hours. This is a great way to ease into presenting if you?re not yet comfortable with public speaking. All of the Tech Talks slots on Tuesday have been reserved for the Women of OpenStack. There are still 15 slots open - It?s not too late to submit a talk!

WEDNESDAY
Afternoon Coffee Break Sync,  4:00-4:30pm
Join your fellow Women of OpenStack to sync up once more during the Summit and provide feedback on how your Summit experience is going thus far. Coffee and snacks will be provided. The exact location will be shared soon.
