Folks-
Thank you Diane, Nikki and Anne for a great Webinar on how to post a 
proposal.  I have put in a proposal (see below for the text), but I need 
two more people on the panel to round it out.  Please send me the email 
address you used for your membership so I can add you to the panel if 
you are interested.   I am also interested in creating a more technical 
panel on possibly how to contribute when working in distributed and 
remote teams.  If any one is interested in that, again drop me a note.

*Women of OpenStack ? Standing Tall in the Room*

In just two amazing years, the Women of Openstack Group grew from a 
breakfast in Portland to an active working part of the OpenStack 
Community.Following an incredible IBM sponsored gathering at the 
beautiful ESPACE 56 in Paris the group held several productive working 
sessions on what to do next.There was agreement all around that it is 
important to encourage and promote more contributions to the Openstack 
project.This workshop is designed not only for women, but for any member 
of the OpenStack community who feels they need a bit of coaching in how 
to gain the confidence to contribute to our amazing and diverse 
community.Join this panel of empowered women as we cover some of the 
tips and tricks for getting heard in an environment filled with many 
egos and opinions. Learn how to navigate the differences between:

?Empowerment, not pushiness

?Confidence not brashness

?Technical prowess not just nerdiness

?Being heard when people are not listening

?Contributions, not bluster

I was, very disappointingly, absent from the webinar due to a rough-start
type of morning. Are there notes, slides, or a recording that could be made
available?

Thank you for the encouragement, Jessica! Next week I'm going heads down
for proposal writing for my own and some co-workers talks. I have a good
track record and getting acceptance (so far!), so I'm happy to read and
offer feedback to anyone who wants it. I'm sure there are others who feel
the same way and would love to help however we can.

Cheers and have a great Thursday,

	mangers
Message-ID: <40C0F0AB86AB6545A465ABE578B8D83A07C39100@G6W2504.americas.hpqcorp.net>

Hello WOO!

I have a panel proposal.  Please read the abstract below and let me know if you are interested.  It is still a little wordy but I intend to cut it down and modify it for the panel representatives.  I?d be open to any of your colleagues who may be interested in sharing community event experiences and techniques.  Do you know someone who throws these OpenStack parties like me?  Please feel free to forward?

I  would also appreciate feedback on the proposal.

I look forward to hearing back from you!
Thanks, Jeanne.

When you host your next community event you will be glad you attended this session.

Imagine your team asks you to host a meetup or even better a mid-cycle meetup.  What is the first panicked thought that comes to your mind?  Is it the venue, cost, attendees, transportation, entertainment, wifi, food, drinks!?  You take a deep breath, you can handle this. Now imagine you are to host an OpenStack Summit event for the entire Summit, in Paris.  You might experience event management stress disorder as you consider foreign culture, language, currency, environment, cuisine!? The deep breaths aren?t helping with your hysteria. You know all issues associated with the event will be tied directly to you, this is a big deal, there?s a lot riding on this, there?s a lot riding on you. Keep breathing, the world isn?t coming to an end.  The creators of the Pavillons de Bercy event in Paris present an OpenStack event playbook.

From this session you will know how to select a venue and vendors, balance your budget (even if it is zero), exceed attendee expectations and gain knowledge of community event culture.  You will have processes, tools and resources that guide you to success without panic.  We will explore the best practices of initiation, planning, execution and closure related to the high pressures of organizing a superb event, whether it?s pizza and beer for 15 or the entire OpenStack Summit.  You will hear funny anecdotes and recommendations from your industry peers to assure your next event is unforgettable in the best way possible.

So friends, geeks, event planners, lend me your ears, for whether thou art a seasoned coordinator of events or a fresh face that hath only just cast thine eyes upon this world of management, all will learn from these words.  OpenStack parties have a competitive environment and although this competition is the fire at our heels keeping us up to snuff, we can simultaneously have a collaborative strategy ensuring unique attendee experiences at every Summit.  We will discuss new strategies for event collaboration based on challenges we all experience. Through this, new ideas will be conjured from the primordial goo that?s left in our brains, ideas we can use in future Summits.

Our open source environment encourages us to reach out as a community and meet up close and personal, face-to-face, eye to eye, heart to heart? okay maybe not that close.  In this culture you can be a leader by gaining the knowledge that gives you identity. You can go to your next community gathering riding upon a golden chariot of confidence, glimmering in the light of genius emanating off of you.  As you step down, doves will soar out from behind you as your events coordinator garb radiates pure power from within. When that day comes, it will be everyone else struggling to breathe.
