Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Command and Presence Workshop (2.5 hrs.) for
 Women at Tokyo, first come first served

Hello Ladies!
A while back Jessica (IBM) had written to brainstorm on what we could offer the Women-of-OpenStack at Tokyo.
Intel has been running for some years a  "Command and Presence" Workshop internally and graduates leave with some winning learnings.


*         Designed to improve confidence while presenting at technical review meetings (think:  design summits, technical committees, internal justifying work and resources meetings)

It simulates challenging dynamics (think: cross-industry, cross-project priorities, and responses that seem dismissive/my-way or no way.

Helps them gain visibility and respect

*         Developed by some brilliant women,  tested and tuned over 4 years, with help from male allies in role playing and post-analysis

With great pleasure Intel would like to bring this to the Women of OpenStack.
First come first served basis, Maximum: 24 people. 2.5 hours long. Monday before the summit kicks off.  Free.
Please respond if interested with:

Preference: Monday morning or afternoon

Please reply to Ruchi Bhargava (ruchi.bhargava at intel.com<mailto:ruchi.bhargava at intel.com>) and
                            Malini Bhandaru (malini.k.bhandaru at intel.com<mailto:malini.k.bhandaru at intel.com>)

Before I graduated from Command-and-Presence, still relatively new at Intel, I would try to go to a meeting SUPER PREPARED, to anticipate every question and be able to answer it.
There is no such thing when you are working at the edge and innovating. Walked away with a tool -"Action Required(s) items", tasks, ones that you will follow up post meeting and update/circle back.

Ruchi and Malini

Thanks for everyone who was able to join us at the Women of OpenStack working session on May 19. A special thanks to our lightening talk speakers: Valerie Aurora<https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=5574129&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=5PuI&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1432849164634%2Ctas%3Avalerie%20aur>, Nina Goradia, and Madhura Maskasky<https://twitter.com/madhuramaskasky> for sharing their experiences and inspiring our group discussions. If you have not already seen the article, Allison Price from the OpenStack Foundation has written a great summary of working session on Superuser: http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-get-more-women-involved-in-tech-communication-leadership-and-mentors

After summarizing the group break out sessions there are very similar themes to what we discussed during our Paris Summit working session. Key areas of focus include:
1. Developing women leaders
2. Increasing the visibility of women in the OpenStack community
3. Mentorship
4. Building a strong communications channel for the Women of OpenStack

Several of you have asked, "What's next?" That is really up to us. We've heard from many of you that you want the Women of OpenStack to continue to work together between summits to address these key issues. To help facilitate follow-on discussions I've included several volunteer sign up sheets in addition to a full group summary in this google drive doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nu_0EperGdXIQifmjHiNVuB2RJb-5bVJkB9oRT-ExVw/edit#gid=0

The goal is for each volunteer group to come together as a team to develop 1-2 key actions they want to accomplish leading up to the Tokyo Summit. There has already been some great progress and discussion on creating an IRC channel which was one of our communication follow-up actions. I'm looking forward to what this group can accomplish in the other areas as well.

Let me know if you have any questions, I am definitely looking forward to continuing the conversation ...

I think this is a great idea for the Tokyo summit, thanks Ruchi and Malini!

All, please be aware of the Travel Support Program and apply by the August
10 deadline -- see https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Travel_Support_Program
for details. I can answer questions you have about the process, or refer
you to someone who knows.

Thanks,
Anne

P.S. Is anyone else struggling to type Tokyo correctly? Sheesh I'm a
terrible speller, there I said it. :)

After summarizing the group break out sessions there are very similar themes to what we discussed during our Paris Summit working session. Key areas of focus include:
1. Developing women leaders
2. Increasing the visibility of women in the OpenStack community
3. Mentorship
4. Building a strong communications channel for the Women of OpenStack

Several of you have asked, "What's next?" That is really up to us. We've heard from many of you that you want the Women of OpenStack to continue to work together between summits to address these key issues. To help facilitate follow-on discussions I've included several volunteer sign up sheets in addition to a full group summary in this google drive doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nu_0EperGdXIQifmjHiNVuB2RJb-5bVJkB9oRT-ExVw/edit#gid=0

The goal is for each volunteer group to come together as a team to develop 1-2 key actions they want to accomplish leading up to the Tokyo Summit. There has already been some great progress and discussion on creating an IRC channel which was one of our communication follow-up actions. I'm looking forward to what this group can accomplish in the other areas as well.

Let me know if you have any questions, I am definitely looking forward to continuing the conversation ...

            first come first served



Hello Ladies!
A while back Jessica (IBM) had written to brainstorm on what we could offer
the Women-of-OpenStack at Tokyo.
Intel has been running for some years a  ?Command and Presence? Workshop
internally and graduates leave with some winning learnings.

      ?         Designed to improve confidence while presenting at
      technical review meetings (think:  design summits, technical
      committees, internal justifying work and resources meetings)
      It simulates challenging dynamics (think: cross-industry,
      cross-project priorities, and responses that seem dismissive/my-way
      or no way.
      Helps them gain visibility and respect
      ?         Developed by some brilliant women,  tested and tuned over 4
      years, with help from male allies in role playing and post-analysis

With great pleasure Intel would like to bring this to the Women of
OpenStack.
First come first served basis, Maximum: 24 people. 2.5 hours long. Monday
before the summit kicks off.  Free.
Please respond if interested with:
Name: First Last
Email:
Company:
Openstack Projects of interest:                (helps to gauge who to
invite for challenge environment)
Current Role:
Goal:   (what you would like to take away)
Preference: Monday morning or afternoon

Please reply to Ruchi Bhargava (ruchi.bhargava at intel.com) and
                            Malini Bhandaru (malini.k.bhandaru at intel.com)

Before I graduated from Command-and-Presence, still relatively new at
Intel, I would try to go to a meeting SUPER PREPARED, to anticipate every
question and be able to answer it.
There is no such thing when you are working at the edge and innovating.
Walked away with a tool ??Action Required(s) items?, tasks, ones that you
will follow up post meeting and update/circle back.
Regards
Ruchi and Malini

Thanks for everyone who was able to join us at the Women of OpenStack
working session on May 19. A special thanks to our lightening talk
speakers: Valerie Aurora, Nina Goradia, and Madhura Maskasky for sharing
their experiences and inspiring our group discussions. If you have not
already seen the article, Allison Price from the OpenStack Foundation has
written a great summary of working session on Superuser:
http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-get-more-women-involved-in-tech-communication-leadership-and-mentors


After summarizing the group break out sessions there are very similar

Thank you ladies for this. I assume it is ok to share with the women of SanDisk in Tokyo.

Also, super impressed with the write-up on Nalee in Korea and will share that with our women as well especially in APAC.

Attached are 3 things we did to celebrate National Women Engineer day last week. I was honored to be able to share the SanDisk STEM and my story. Hope this is useful to you.

________________________________



Hello Ladies!
A while back Jessica (IBM) had written to brainstorm on what we could offer the Women-of-OpenStack at Tokyo.
Intel has been running for some years a ?Command and Presence? Workshop internally and graduates leave with some winning learnings.
? Designed to improve confidence while presenting at technical review meetings (think: design summits, technical committees, internal justifying work and resources meetings)
It simulates challenging dynamics (think: cross-industry, cross-project priorities, and responses that seem dismissive/my-way or no way.
Helps them gain visibility and respect
? Developed by some brilliant women, tested and tuned over 4 years, with help from male allies in role playing and post-analysis

With great pleasure Intel would like to bring this to the Women of OpenStack.
First come first served basis, Maximum: 24 people. 2.5 hours long. Monday before the summit kicks off. Free.
Please respond if interested with:
Name: First Last

Openstack Projects of interest: (helps to gauge who to invite for challenge environment)
Current Role:
Goal: (what you would like to take away)
Preference: Monday morning or afternoon

Please reply to Ruchi Bhargava (ruchi.bhargava at intel.com<mailto:ruchi.bhargava at intel.com>) and
Malini Bhandaru (malini.k.bhandaru at intel.com<mailto:malini.k.bhandaru at intel.com>)

Before I graduated from Command-and-Presence, still relatively new at Intel, I would try to go to a meeting SUPER PREPARED, to anticipate every question and be able to answer it.
There is no such thing when you are working at the edge and innovating. Walked away with a tool ??Action Required(s) items?, tasks, ones that you will follow up post meeting and update/circle back.

Ruchi and Malini

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Women of OpenStack working session summary and next steps

Thanks for everyone who was able to join us at the Women of OpenStack working session on May 19. A special thanks to our lightening talk speakers: Valerie Aurora<https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=5574129&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=5PuI&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1432849164634%2Ctas%3Avalerie%20aur>, Nina Goradia, and Madhura Maskasky<https://twitter.com/madhuramaskasky> for sharing their experiences and inspiring our group discussions. If you have not already seen the article, Allison Price from the OpenStack Foundation has written a great summary of working session on Superuser: http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-get-more-women-involved-in-tech-communication-leadership-and-mentors

After summarizing the group break out sessions there are very similar themes to what we discussed during our Paris Summit working session. Key areas of focus include:
1. Developing women leaders
2. Increasing the visibility of women in the OpenStack community
3. Mentorship
4. Building a strong communications channel for the Women of OpenStack

Several of you have asked, "What's next?" That is really up to us. We've heard from many of you that you want the Women of OpenStack to continue to work together between summits to address these key issues. To help facilitate follow-on discussions I've included several volunteer sign up sheets in addition to a full group summary in this google drive doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nu_0EperGdXIQifmjHiNVuB2RJb-5bVJkB9oRT-ExVw/edit#gid=0

The goal is for each volunteer group to come together as a team to develop 1-2 key actions they want to accomplish leading up to the Tokyo Summit. There has already been some great progress and discussion on creating an IRC channel which was one of our communication follow-up actions. I'm looking forward to what this group can accomplish in the other areas as well.

Let me know if you have any questions, I am definitely looking forward to continuing the conversation ...

Nalee, sorry to disappoint, but this offering is not aligned with your goal of  ?Understating SDN for Neutron  (what you would like to take away)?.
We seek to equip people with techniques to help them succeed in presentations and meetings.
It will not be subject matter specific.

Hi. Malini

Actually I didn't know what goal.
so I want to change my goal below.
*Need women leaders to be more visible in the OpenStack main tent sessions*
How do you think it?

Just wanted to thank everyone for encouraging women to summit a talk. It
worked at least for me ;). The webinar was a great help. I have submitted
my first talk and will be sharing the stage with one of my colleague
("Don?t fly solo"! ).

Cheers,
Claire

I may want to rephrase "will be sharing the stage with a colleague" with
"am sharing the presentation with a colleague", as we are not there yet :)

That's awesome! I'm so glad that webinar is still relevant. I even sent out
the superuser summary a couple of times this week:

http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-craft-a-successful-openstack-summit-proposal

It's open until a minute before midnight PDT! :)

Go go go.

I would also echo Claire's words. The superuser summary
<http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-craft-a-successful-openstack-summit-proposal>
and webinar <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxFYNZ4jqik>motivated me to
submit my first talk ("Youngest OpenStackers?! +2 for the community!") with
few of my colleagues at Intel!
Thanks everyone!

Cheers,

Message-ID: <A4F01F6B-F03D-46C4-8064-2E22C6A804A1@openstack.org>

HI everyone,

If you?re planning to attend the next OpenStack Summit in Tokyo then please plan to arrive in town early - either on Sunday, October 25 or first thing in the morning on Monday, October 26.

The Women of OpenStack Networking Event that?s proudly sponsored by IBM & Intel will take place on the afternoon of Monday, October 26.  Also, the Command and Presence Workshop (that Maliini and Ruchi previously emailed about on a separate string) will be scheduled on the morning of Monday, October 26. 

Both of these events are hosted by and created for YOU - the Women of OpenStack. Both of these events are scheduled at the beginning of the week to avoid conflicting with other important Summit sessions and also to allow you the opportunity to get to know each other in person before the Summit officially kicks-off on Tuesday.

For reference - the main conference, keynotes, design summit, marketplace expo hall and other Summit content all opens / begins on Tuesday, October 27. 

If any of you require an invitation letter from OpenStack Foundation that invites you to attend the Monday events in order to justify an additional day of travel expenses then please let us know! We are more than happy to help you make the case to your employer as to why you should be able to attend the Monday, October 26 WOO events. :)

We?ll be sharing many more details in the coming months. Stay tuned! 

In the meantime you can find general summit info here: https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/ <https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/>

Cheers,
Claire

I would also echo Claire's words. The superuser summary<http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-craft-a-successful-openstack-summit-proposal> and webinar <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxFYNZ4jqik> motivated me to submit my first talk ("Youngest OpenStackers?! +2 for the community!") with few of my colleagues at Intel!
Thanks everyone!

Cheers,
Deepti

Just wanted to thank everyone for encouraging women to summit a talk. It worked at least for me ;). The webinar was a great help. I have submitted my first talk and will be sharing the stage with one of my colleague ("Don?t fly solo"! ).

That's awesome! I'm so glad that webinar is still relevant. I even sent out the superuser summary a couple of times this week:

http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-craft-a-successful-openstack-summit-proposal

It's open until a minute before midnight PDT! :)

Go go go.

Is it me or there is no way to see if the vote has been applied? When I

Hi Claire, 

When you click a particular option to vote, the button should turn blue to indicate your selection. Is this not happening?

Hi ladies, 

I'm new around here, but I'd be very happy if you could vote for this talk. (I didn't waste time, did I?)

Telemetry for NFV in OpenStack

Hopefully, I'll get to present at my first summit.
Thanks in advance :)

Emma
