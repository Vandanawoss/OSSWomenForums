Hello,
We are so pleased to again offer Speed Mentoring on the first day of the
Boston summit.   The time has recently moved from Monday morning (too
early!) to Monday lunch.  We have 20 fabulous mentors signed up and 5 great
volunteers.  We have space for lots more mentees!
So if you know of someone new to the community, coming to their first
summit, or just looking to grow their network, please invite them to come
to Speed Mentoring.


            Speed Mentoring Lunch sponsored by Intel - Monday May 8,
            12:50-1:50PM
            Open to anyone of any gender or experience looking for
            technical or career advice.


            How will it go?


            You'll meet with a mentor in a small group of mentees
            in short intervals.  Mentors will answer questions and share
            their experience about how to grow in the community. It's a
            fast-paced event and a great way to meet new people, start the
            summit, and be welcomed into the OpenStack community. Mentees
            are asked to provide 3 questions they would like answered when
            they sign up.  We'll ask mentors to focus their answers around
            these questions.


            Sign up here:
            https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/summit-schedule/events/18680/speed-mentoring-lunch-sponsored-by-intel

The votes are in and for the Boston Women of OpenStack lunch we will hold a
panel discussion with women who have had a significant career in Open
Source! Thanks to Maria-Rita Villari for helping frame this topic and I
appreciate all the ideas submitted.

19 days and counting until the Boston Summit .... I am looking forward to
the panel discussion and the table discussion it will generate afterwards.

Subject:	Looking for your input for WOO Boston working lunch
            topics/speakers


The Women of OpenStack's working session for the Boston summit is moving to
lunch time on Tuesday, May 9, 12:50pm-1:50pm. (yea! no more early
mornings!!!)

This is a great opportunity for you to meet other Women of OpenStack and
help build your new network in a relaxed setting.

It has been one of most highly attended WOO focused sessions for the past
2-3 years with 100+ attendees, so make sure you register for the session
here:
https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/summit-schedule/events/18648/women-of-openstack-lunch-sponsored-by-ibm

As we have done in the past, the format will be 2-3 lightening (10 minute)
talks followed by small group / table discussion.

We'd love to hear from you -- and what you are interested in talking about
during lunch. Please share your suggestions for topic and speaker
suggestions using this format in this etherpad:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Boston_WOO_working_lunch

Speaker:

If you have a great topic but you don't know of the right speaker,  please
share your idea and we can try and find a speaker.
