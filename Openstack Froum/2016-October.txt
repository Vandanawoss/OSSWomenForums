Subject: [Women-of-openstack] [Mentoring] Call for Mentors for Barcelona
	events
Message-ID: <OF566BB698.F2A5D650-ON00258041.00750CDB-85258041.00751EAA@notes.na.collabserv.com>



Hello,
We have two (2) great mentoring opportunities coming up for the Barcelona
summit.  These are a fairly short time commitment, so please consider
taking a few hours to help out people new to the community.

   Upstream University - Sunday October 23rd, 1:00-5:00PM & Monday, October
   24th, 10:00AM-4:00PM
   Schedule information here -
   https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/summit-schedule/events/16638/upstream-university-day-1

   Looking for 5-10 mentors to float around the training rooms, helping
   students who are stuck and offering advice.  Please sign up on the
   mentor signup form -
   https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/mentor_mentee_signup_pre_barcelona
   , put "Upstream university only" under "Additional information about
   yourself.  You do *not* need to RSVP to the event on the schedule app if
   you fill out the formstack form.

   Speed Mentoring Breakfast sponsored by Intel - Tuesday, October 25,
   7:30-8:35AM
   Schedule information here -
   https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/summit-schedule/events/16889/speed-mentoring-organized-by-women-of-openstack-sponsored-by-intel

   We're looking for 10-20 mentors, who are interested in offering either
   technical or career advice.  You'll meet with small groups of mentees in
   15 minute intervals and answer their questions about how to grow in the
   community.  It's a fast paced event and a great way to meet new people
   and introduce them to the summit.  Mentors should plan to arrive at
   7:15AM, although we will provide breakfast and caffeine!
   Please sign up via the schedule and select "mentor".  We will contact
   mentors ahead of time and hold a short call to go over logistics of the
   event shortly before the summit.

Thanks in advance for volunteering!
Sincerely,
Emily Kate Hugenbruch

We'd like to learn more about Women of OpenStack by gathering more
information about the women who make up our community.


We've created a 5 question survey that is being distributed to the Women of
OpenStack distribution list. The goal of the survey is to learn a little
more about the women in our community, your role working with OpenStack,
and where you'd like to see the Women of OpenStack focus our future
efforts.


Link to survey: http://ibm.biz/WOO_2016_Survey


Your responses are anonymous and the survey will take you 2-3 minutes to
complete. Please complete the survey by Monday, October 10.


We appreciate the men who support the Women of OpenStack, but we ask that
the responses come from the women in the community. We will share a summary
of the responses at the Barcelona summit at the Wednesday morning working
breakfast and with the Women of Openstack distribution list.

Hi All,

I am going to my first OpenStack Summit in Barcelona and I would like to
visit some events organized by WOO.

First of all let me introduce myself. My name is Hana and I work for tcp
cloud as Account Manager. This year I organized the first OpenStack Days
Prague and in Barcelona I will be at Panel discussing What I have Learned
as an OpenStack Day Organizer.

I am so happy to be in Barcelona and looking forward to meet all of you
from WOO community during sessions, breakfast or other events.

I really appreciate to be part of this community. Could you please help me
if I should know more information about the community before the Summit.

Best regards

Hana

Hi all,

The digital version of the WOO specific Summit map will be available to share with you next week and hard copies will be distributed onsite in Barcelona. The map will call out several things that aren?t included on the main Summit schedule - like WOO welcome greeters on Monday/Tuesday, dedicated WOO lunch tables, and the WOO Meet-up area inside the Marketplace Mixer. 

The WOO Meet-up will be on Monday, Oct 24 during the Marketplace Mixer. This gathering, sponsored by Comcast, will take place 5:00-7:00pm in the lounge area on the backside of Headline Booth B1 (backside of the Deutsche Telekom booth). Please plan to join us there!

In the meantime, this link aggregates all session that are currently on the Summit schedule and include the tag ?women-of-openstack?. It includes both the Tuesday and Wednesday morning breakfasts and is a good starting point for you to reference.

http://bit.ly/BarcelonaWOO <http://bit.ly/BarcelonaWOO>

Cheers,
Claire

We're looking for 5 folks to help with room support for the Git and Gerrit Lunch and Learn to be held Wednesday October 26 from 1:05-2:55 at the Hilton Diagonal Mar - Floor 0 - Ballroom C. Basic knowledge of Git and Gerrit is helpful as you'll be helping attendees with questions during the presentation. Students tend to run Mac and Linux, but there are some Windows users.


If you or someone you know uses Git and Gerrit and can help please let us know and if anyone knows Windows and can help even for a short time we'd appreciate it!


Thanks,


Amy

Subject:	Invitation: Women of OpenStack Demographic Survey open until
            Tuesday, Oct 11


We'd like to learn more about Women of OpenStack by gathering more
information about the women who make up our community.


We've created a 5 question survey that is being distributed to the Women of
OpenStack distribution list. The goal of the survey is to learn a little
more about the women in our community, your role working with OpenStack,
and where you'd like to see the Women of OpenStack focus our future
efforts.


Link to survey: http://ibm.biz/WOO_2016_Survey


Your responses are anonymous and the survey will take you 2-3 minutes to
complete. Please complete the survey by Monday, October 10.


We appreciate the men who support the Women of OpenStack, but we ask that
the responses come from the women in the community. We will share a summary
of the responses at the Barcelona summit at the Wednesday morning working
breakfast and with the Women of Openstack distribution list.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Barcelona Summit Map specific for WOO
Message-ID: <51A96BC8-D3D7-4FA1-9C39-5987BD80B70E@openstack.org>

Hi all,

As promised, attached you?ll find the Barcelona Summit map that highlights some of the key Women of OpenStack specific events happening throughout the week. We will also distribute hardcopies of these maps onsite in Barcelona. 

Few reminders:
- All Summit sessions that include the tag ?women-of-openstack?, including Tuesday and Wednesday morning breakfasts, can be found using this link: http://bit.ly/BarcelonaWOO <http://bit.ly/BarcelonaWOO>.

 - Make sure to look for the WOO welcome greeters in the registration lobby on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning.  
 
- Join us for the WOO Welcome Meet-up on Monday, Oct 24 during the Marketplace Mixer. This gathering, sponsored by Comcast, will take place 5:00-7:00pm in the lounge area on the backside of Headline Booth B1 (backside of the Deutsche Telekom booth) shown on the map. 

Cheers,
Claire

Hi

I am Janki Chhatbar. I work in RedHat and contribute to OpenStack actively.

This would be my first summit. I would like to volunteer at the summit and
help out in any way possible.

I understand this might be a little late for this, I was waiting for visa.

Any guidance/pointer would be much appreciated.

Thanks

Hi Janki,
This isn't a volunteering opportunity, but you're welcome to come to the
Speed Mentoring breakfast to meet some other first time attendees:
https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/summit-schedule/events/16889/speed-mentoring-organized-by-women-of-openstack-sponsored-by-intel

If you're already an upstream contributor and you'll be in Barcelona a few
days early, we're in need of mentors to help out with Upstream University
on Sunday and Monday
https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/summit-schedule/events/16638/upstream-university-day-1
  You can send a note to Ildiko (ildiko.vancsa at gmail.com) if you're
interested in helping out either or both days.

Thanks!
Sincerely,
Emily Kate Hugenbruch

If you're already an upstream contributor and you'll be in Barcelona a few days early, we're in need of mentors to help out with Upstream University on Sunday and Monday 
https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/summit-schedule/events/16638/upstream-university-day-1  You can send a note to Ildiko (ildiko.vancsa at gmail.com) if you're interested in helping out either or both days.

Hi

I am Janki Chhatbar. I work in RedHat and contribute to OpenStack actively.

This would be my first summit. I would like to volunteer at the summit and help out in any way possible.

I understand this might be a little late for this, I was waiting for visa.

Any guidance/pointer would be much appreciated.

Thanks
Janki
