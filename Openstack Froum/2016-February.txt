Folks -
Here is more about the panel:


Following up on the themes related to gender equality presented at the previous Summit talks sponsored by The Women of OpenStack working group, this session will focus on our vision of a world where the OpenStack community is truly and completely blind to meaningless differences in gender, color, creed and culture. What will this new world look like? How will it differ from the current one?

A panel of people from all walks of life will explore what that future is and what we can do as a community as a whole to achieve it.

I am looking for a man who is supportive of the OpenStack culture of inclusivity and can represent the man's perspective of how we will reach full equality.

Thanks!

Imad Sousou is passionate about this and on the OpenStack board of
directors. He is available and very interested in being the male
representative on this panel. Please let me know who I should work with on
next steps.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] OpenStack Mentoring
Message-ID: <etPan.56b28fda.33de3bb7.10e9@MICHAELs-MacBook-Pro.local>

Mentoring is an important tool for growing our OpenStack community. ?Mentors help new community members come on board and existing community members expand their skills and reputation. ?Mentees help their mentors expand their worldview and challenge their mindset. This process of gaining knowledge and challenging existing ideas is vital to our community.

The OpenStack community currently has a few levels of mentoring:

* Outreachy mentoring - an intense internship-type experience over a particular three month period https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy.
* Upstream University - a two-day class for beginners in the community, held on-site the two days prior to the summit

The Women of OpenStack group has seen the need for additional types of mentoring, specifically long term but lightweight mentoring aimed at bringing together mentors and mentees who may not be co-located. ?

* Technical mentoring - mentorship is spread over several months. Mentors with experience in a particular area of OpenStack help their mentees grow in that area. This could be a focus area like release management or marketing, or a particular project like Nova or Neutron.
* Career mentoring - mentorship is spread out over several months or years. Mentors help their mentees define what kind of career they'd like in the community and move towards those goals. ??

Mentors and mentees may or may not have the same focus area in the community. We hope to kick off these new mentoring programs before the Austin summit, to tie in with a new Speed Mentoring session there.

We are currently looking for mentors of all shapes, sizes and backgrounds to take part in the program pilot. ?Mentors should have between 1 and 4 hours a month free to spend with their menthe. ?

Read our guidelines (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxtM4AiszlEyVkEtdktmWjBPN3c/view) and if you're ready to sign up, please fill out our questionnaire https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/mentoring!

There is an optional speed mentoring session that will be on April 25th Monday morning at the OpenStack conference in Austin before the first keynote. In this event, mentees will be able to meet a variety of mentors in a short amount of time to see who they would like to pair up with. Please check the appropriate box on the questionnaire form if you?re interested in attending.

I would love to see a Upstream University on-demand course developed. Those that can't attend the summit but need more in-depth knowledge of how to contribute would benefit greatly.

We are currently looking for mentors of all shapes, sizes and backgrounds to take part in the program pilot. ?Mentors should have between 1 and 4 hours a month free to spend with their menthe. ?

Read our guidelines (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxtM4AiszlEyVkEtdktmWjBPN3c/view) and if you're ready to sign up, please fill out our questionnaire https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/mentoring!

There is an optional speed mentoring session that will be on April 25th Monday morning at the OpenStack conference in Austin before the first keynote. In this event, mentees will be able to meet a variety of mentors in a short amount of time to see who they would like to pair up with. Please check the appropriate box on the questionnaire form if you?re interested in attending.

Hello Women of OpenStack,
About a month ago, I proposed coming up with a logo for Women of OpenStack. Heidi Tretheway offered to help us get started, however I haven't been able to get a hold of her via email. Is there anyone else I can talk to to get started with a logo?
Thanks!

There are a few brand guidelines?that we should flag, including not adjusting/adapting the existing OpenStack logo (such as recoloring or reshaping it, and not taking the stacked O and using it as part of a new logo) that we have to enforce to support other global trademark concerns. While some projects have built their own logos, there?s not a lot of consistency and we don?t encourage them to protect the brand equity of the OpenStack logo.
I?d start by asking the larger question - why is a logo needed? Most projects and working groups don?t have them. It sounds like the key issue for WOO is to have a mark of distinction on a badge or on a participant, which could also be used in a pamphlet or presentation. In lieu of a logo contest, may I suggest that a few WOO folks work with the foundation design team to discuss how we can help identify members? We can discuss badge options, etc. Perhaps at the Monday meeting, 2 or 3 people could volunteer to guide that?
I?ll be happy to answer any an all questions on logos & brand going forward! And I wholeheartedly support helping to identify WOO members. :-)

Amy 

I don't think we have a logo. ?But it is a good idea to perhaps create one starting the Austin Summit. ?Similar to how each project like Cinder etc. have an icon associated with it. 

On the original email suggesting some identification, the icon would help certainly. Some events like the Linux Con events, allow you to select various topics that you want showing on your badge. ?So people know the topics you are interested in. ?This could be where we could identify ourselves as part of WOOS and knowledgeable. 

I will add this to the agenda for Monday's WOOS meeting.

I definitely agree about the IRC nicks being bigger because most people only know you by your nick. But there are plenty of folks who are attending and aren?t on IRC so I can see why it?s not as prevalent on the badge but they should be readable from a short distance.

A related question is does the Women of Openstack have a logo or even a conference related logo? It?d be nice to utilize it in presentations as we?re going to make the pamphlet of talks again.

I started thinking it would be cool if the Women of OpenStack could 
have something on their badges, like a sticker, or maybe a pin or 
something (flair!) that said "Ask me about Women of OpenStack!", so 
that we could all be ambassadors and welcome newbies into the group. 
I mean, granted, being women at an OpenStack summit might imply that 
we know a thing or two about Women of OpenStack. But, it might give 
us more of an identity (like a secret handshake, but an open, 
welcoming, friendly one :).


We're not all women :)

I like the idea because it helps mark out those people who are happy to 
be asked about such things from those who'd rather get on with being 
attendees.

Will there be space on the badge? I remember them being fairly crowded 
already, if anything I'd like people's IRC nicks to be larger. A "pin"
(badge to us British) or maybe one of those rubber bracelets would be 
easier imo, also easier to take off if you want to be left alone for a 
bit.

Please don't make it super pink, pink is a fine colour but let's not 
follow that coding.

There are a few brand guidelines?that we should flag, including not adjusting/adapting the existing OpenStack logo (such as recoloring or reshaping it, and not taking the stacked O and using it as part of a new logo) that we have to enforce to support other global trademark concerns. While some projects have built their own logos, there?s not a lot of consistency and we don?t encourage them to protect the brand equity of the OpenStack logo.
I?d start by asking the larger question - why is a logo needed? Most projects and working groups don?t have them. It sounds like the key issue for WOO is to have a mark of distinction on a badge or on a participant, which could also be used in a pamphlet or presentation. In lieu of a logo contest, may I suggest that a few WOO folks work with the foundation design team to discuss how we can help identify members? We can discuss badge options, etc. Perhaps at the Monday meeting, 2 or 3 people could volunteer to guide that?
I?ll be happy to answer any an all questions on logos & brand going forward! And I wholeheartedly support helping to identify WOO members. :-)

Amy 

I don't think we have a logo. ?But it is a good idea to perhaps create one starting the Austin Summit. ?Similar to how each project like Cinder etc. have an icon associated with it. 

On the original email suggesting some identification, the icon would help certainly. Some events like the Linux Con events, allow you to select various topics that you want showing on your badge. ?So people know the topics you are interested in. ?This could be where we could identify ourselves as part of WOOS and knowledgeable. 

I will add this to the agenda for Monday's WOOS meeting.

I definitely agree about the IRC nicks being bigger because most people only know you by your nick. But there are plenty of folks who are attending and aren?t on IRC so I can see why it?s not as prevalent on the badge but they should be readable from a short distance.

A related question is does the Women of Openstack have a logo or even a conference related logo? It?d be nice to utilize it in presentations as we?re going to make the pamphlet of talks again.

I started thinking it would be cool if the Women of OpenStack could 
have something on their badges, like a sticker, or maybe a pin or 
something (flair!) that said "Ask me about Women of OpenStack!", so 
that we could all be ambassadors and welcome newbies into the group. 
I mean, granted, being women at an OpenStack summit might imply that 
we know a thing or two about Women of OpenStack. But, it might give 
us more of an identity (like a secret handshake, but an open, 
welcoming, friendly one :).


We're not all women :)

I like the idea because it helps mark out those people who are happy to 
be asked about such things from those who'd rather get on with being 
attendees.

Will there be space on the badge? I remember them being fairly crowded 
already, if anything I'd like people's IRC nicks to be larger. A "pin"
(badge to us British) or maybe one of those rubber bracelets would be 
easier imo, also easier to take off if you want to be left alone for a 
bit.

Please don't make it super pink, pink is a fine colour but let's not 
follow that coding.
