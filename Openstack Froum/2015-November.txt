Hey guys,

I was assuming the meeting for today was cancelled but saw it on my calendar still. Were we planning on meeting? Someone was asking on channel so wanted to confirm either way.

Thanks,

Amy

PS It was nice putting faces to names last week!

Hi Amy - Good question. I think we should cancel this week and pickup next week. In addition to Tokyo follow-up and setting action plan, I think we should also discuss frequency for meetings.

Beth - Can you send out a cancelation for today's meeting?
Thanks
Carol

I would like to suggest an agenda item for next week's meeting .  When I retweeted the Women of OpenStack picture, I got a number of questions on how many of the women in OpenStack are developers contributing code.  They want role models in the community.
 Bitergia is a company that OpenStack foundation uses to create the stats behind "the state of OpenStack".  Why not work with them on getting more information on women contributing patches to the various projects.     I would like to suggest we discuss this next time.

Beth, Carol and Jessica - thanks again for your leadership and all the work that the foundation does - Claire and others to make this a thriving community.

Thank You,

@Nithya: OpenStack also makes use of Stackalytics (http://stackalytics.com/)
to see the number of contributions / patches submitted by an individual to
a particular project. In this, we also have the information about the
contributions been made by a particular company and on a specific OpenStack
Project.

May be this can also be used to see the contributions been made by women to
a particular project. Thoughts?

Thanks Nitin. Was not aware of this and this does make sense.  Best to send the query to OpenStack foundation to submit the way they think would be best.  I am most interested in the answer.

On a separate, but related note, the following statement sounds like it might imply that non-code contributors aren't necessarily considered 'role models in the community' or perhaps there could be a misunderstanding that their contributions aren't as valued as code contributions. Am I interpreting this incorrectly? If not, we should help emphasise the importance of all contribution types.

"I got a number of questions on how many of the women in OpenStack are developers contributing code.  They want role models in the community."

+1 to adding this to the agenda along with stats related to the various contribution types.

 Bitergia is a company that OpenStack foundation uses to create the stats behind "the state of OpenStack".  Why not work with them on getting more information on women contributing patches to the various projects.     I would like to suggest we discuss this next time.

Also, the source code for Stackalytics is available on Stackforge (
https://github.com/openstack/stackalytics). So, anyone can submit patches
and enhance its features.

This may also be proposed an a project for an Outreachy Program!

Linda

When I got the question on twitter, my first response was the same - all contributions are valuable and in fact there are many ways to contribute.  However, 2 developers persisted in asking how many of them were there in the list of contributors.  Please see the conversation thread below.

On a separate, but related note, the following statement sounds like it might imply that non-code contributors aren't necessarily considered 'role models in the community' or perhaps there could be a misunderstanding that their contributions aren't as valued as code contributions. Am I interpreting this incorrectly? If not, we should help emphasise the importance of all contribution types.

"I got a number of questions on how many of the women in OpenStack are developers contributing code.  They want role models in the community."

+1 to adding this to the agenda along with stats related to the various contribution types.

 Bitergia is a company that OpenStack foundation uses to create the stats behind "the state of OpenStack".  Why not work with them on getting more information on women contributing patches to the various projects.     I would like to suggest we discuss this next time.

Hi Amy - Good question. I think we should cancel this week and pickup next week. In addition to Tokyo follow-up and setting action plan, I think we should also discuss frequency for meetings.

Beth - Can you send out a cancelation for today's meeting?
Thanks

Hey guys,

I was assuming the meeting for today was cancelled but saw it on my calendar still. Were we planning on meeting? Someone was asking on channel so wanted to confirm either way.

Thanks,

Amy

I agree, while there was a record number of women attendees , I was disappointed by the low number of women technical contributors! At least 50% of the women I met were in non-technical roles. 

I did meet some great people there, but I was expecting many more female ATCs, when there was a big fuss about the large number of women attending.

Emma

What was the official percentage of female attendees? At one point I heard
6%, which is lower than previous summits which, if I recall correctly, were
between 9-11%.

The picture is great!!

HI All,

Here?s some data on the Tokyo Summit:

- 11% of Summit attendees were women - this is a slight increase from previous Summits. 
- 24% of these women attendees had the ATC designation printed on their name badges. I?m sure that many of the women who did not have ATC label printed on their badges also contributed to OpenStack in other ways or may have a technical role but did not contribute code to the recent release cycles and therefore did not receive the ATC designation. 

I personally did not witness any big fuss about the large quantity of women Summit attendees. Instead I noticed an acknowledgement that women are unfortunately still an underrepresented minority in the OpenStack community but progress is slowly and steadily being made to improve this lack of diversity. 

Cheers,
Claire

Interesting?.and yet, I don?t think Gender is a required field (or maybe a field at all) when it comes to ATCs.

My response would be:

Unfortunately, the current tools in place do not allow for breaking down contributions by gender. Happy to help find you a mentor!

Linda

When I got the question on twitter, my first response was the same ? all contributions are valuable and in fact there are many ways to contribute.  However, 2 developers persisted in asking how many of them were there in the list of contributors.  Please see the conversation thread below.

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] Meeting today

On a separate, but related note, the following statement sounds like it might imply that non-code contributors aren't necessarily considered 'role models in the community' or perhaps there could be a misunderstanding that their contributions aren't as valued as code contributions. Am I interpreting this incorrectly? If not, we should help emphasise the importance of all contribution types.

"I got a number of questions on how many of the women in OpenStack are developers contributing code.  They want role models in the community."

+1 to adding this to the agenda along with stats related to the various contribution types.

Hi Amy ? Good question. I think we should cancel this week and pickup next week. In addition to Tokyo follow-up and setting action plan, I think we should also discuss frequency for meetings.

Beth ? Can you send out a cancelation for today?s meeting?

Hey guys,

I was assuming the meeting for today was cancelled but saw it on my calendar still. Were we planning on meeting? Someone was asking on channel so wanted to confirm either way.

Thanks,

PS It was nice putting faces to names last week!

So, I am brand spankin' new-- with the exception of my attendance at Paris.
My goal for Tokyo was to NOT go. I have other projects in other communities
where I am the PTL. For example, in OPNFV, I am the #3 committer as of this
morning (http://projects.bitergia.com/opnfv/browser/scm.html). As you can
see, we also use Bitergia for such stats.

I was absolutely blown away in Tokyo. And I attribute this 100% to WOO. It
helped that I also had a great mentor in Rocky.

I am a developer with 21+ years in open source, but mostly working with
kernel file systems and protocol stacks. My python skills are beyond rusty.
But they're there. I mostly work these days in C, C++, bash, and java. But
my skills and experience go way beyond these languages. These are just the
current ones I am using. If I don't use them, I tend to forget stuff and
have to Google a lot. But I expect my python will ramp back up by the next
summit.

I currently have two projects that are intercepting OpenStack-- one adds a
Neutron/ML2 plugin for ONOS, and the other introduces API extensions to
Nova in support of Cloudlets (Edge Computing Offload).

It is really difficult, as I was just telling someone this morning, to be a
spectator participant in OpenStack. Everything moves too fast and the face
to face interaction seems pretty critical. This is not the easiest thing if
you happen to be highly introverted and one to not really like crowds or
public gatherings.

So, I am still no one special in OpenStack. But I am keenly interested in
Nova. In NFV, where I was an editor for the Compute Domain portion of the
Infrastructure WG standards, I called out an issue with respect to
obtaining and using "Utilization" info to affect optimal provisioning. This
was back in 2013. And from the meetings and discussions last week, it
sounds like I wasn't far off. With that, I've been encouraged to look at
the Nova scheduler to see if there are improvements to be made.

Anyway, if it weren't for the diversity emphasis making me feel so welcome,
I wouldn't be resolved to become a contributor in the upcoming releases.

I hope that this group has had similar positive impact on others as well.

Thank you all for the help, support, and encouragement.

Best,

Ash

This is very good to hear.    One of the things that we did discuss in our breakout group during the Women?s breakfast is to profile and talk about various contributors ? technical and otherwise to show the roles women are playing and the impact they are making on OpenStack.   Also having a baseline on projects and seeing how many ATCs, PTLs etc. will go a long way to both highlight as well as have a goal in terms of where we need to go.   Something else to discuss at the next meeting.

Message-ID: <D25E2E21.59BF9%nikacost@cisco.com>

This bums me out. Maybe I?m taking this personally, but being
?disappointed" and following that with ?at least 50% of the women I met
were in non-technical roles? makes it seem like women (like myself) are
somehow less valuable or important because we?re not technical
contributors. Perhaps that is not your intent. Nevertheless, I wanted to
share some thoughts on this subject, as it?s come up quite a bit.

During a past summit, someone made a comment in a panel that they were
?offended? that someone came to the booth and thought they were ?in
marketing.? A few women in the room took offense to that statement, and I
understood why. It was as though marketers were somehow less important and
less valuable than contributors and developers. A woman in the audience
stood up, walked to the mic, and asked folks to stop saying ?they thought
I was in marketing like it?s a bad thing.? She was right. That exchange
made me realize that subconscious bias exists even amongst women in the
same group.

As women, we should support each other!

If it weren?t for the brilliant women (and men) of OpenStack who share
their expertise around public relations, social media, marketing, business
development, branding, copywriting, communications, analyst relations,
event planning, presentation authoring/coaching, and probably a whole lot
of other stuff that I?m probably forgetting, what would OpenStack look
like? There would be no summit. There would be no Women of OpenStack
events. There would be no SuperUser magazine or newsletter.There would be
no ?We Are OpenStack? campaign. OpenStack would NOT EXIST.

At then end of each day, we?re all human. We all have different skills,
different talents, and different abilities. The cool part is that people
from all around the globe are building something that is fundamentally
changing humanity? something bigger than ourselves. And while the code and
docs are created by technical contributors, the other side of OpenStack
keeps that foundation strong and vibrant and growing. And that?s pretty
cool. 

Apologies if this offended anyone. That definitely was not my intent. My
intent is to help us be more inclusive and embrace diversity? no matter
what is printed on your badge.

I have nothing against non-technical people, and I meant no offence, but I'm looking at it from a different point-of-view than you are. Maybe my view is skewed, as the majority of the men I met were technical, and it seemed that the majority of the women I met were not technical. I got the feeling that technical women were highly underrepresented at the summit. I don't know what the over-all statistics were for technical/non-technical male/female overall, but I just saw the women as a majority non-technical group, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it would leave me feeling that being a technical women puts me in much more of a minority than I thought. i.e. I was expecting to find women in a similar role to myself.

It might also be to do with the fact that I expected a lot more technical people overall, as that is where I'm coming from, working in a technical team in a large company, where marketing and other non-technical people are kept separate to a great extent.

TLDR; My previous experience does not include a huge amount of collaboration with non-tech people, which skewed my expectations.

In general:
Tech people engage with tech people as they know the product on a different level to non-technical people. Same goes for non-tech, the marketing guy is not going to want to talk to the kernel engineer when talking about (e.g.) the newest distro, they'll just want to know about a feature at a high level, and not how many lines of code and what algorithms were used to implement the feature.

To address the problem of people being disappointed at meeting a marketing person at a booth:
    A technical person is going to want to talk tech, and will be expecting technical person (as well as marketing) to be available to answer their technical questions. I'm not saying a marketing person wouldn't be able to answer these, but the tech person would be better qualified to discuss the highly technical stuff, as it would be their area of expertise.

So don't be offended if I want to talk tech with other technical people, and was disappointed that I didn't find as many as I was expecting in the group. Any non-technical person would feel lost in a room of engineers.

Regards,
Emma

Glad you expanded upon your experiences. Let me give you some more
perspective if I may.

There's good reason to be concerned about some sort of call-out in amount
of technical-ness of any individual contributor. We're unfortunately in an
industry where this practice continues to shove women in to a category
that's considered "lesser." I'd recommend this article:
https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/c-is-manly-python-is-for-n00bs-how-false-stereotypes-turn-into-technical-truths


Pull quotes that really spoke to me:
  * "A major reason to eradicate these false stereotypes is that they
perpetuate biases against women."
  * "While those on the outside are still struggling to prove themselves,
the technically privileged have gone ahead to determine what the software
that runs our lives should look like."
  * "Judgments about language use, despite being far from ?objective? or
?technical,? set up a hierarchy among programmers that systematically
privileges certain groups."

I've been more aware of the loss of power or privilege by choosing to be in
an "other" category since my focus is documentation. It happens to be
highly technical, but people often overlook or even look down upon it as a
contribution. Same for "oh you're a database administrator" or "oh, you are
a web developer." Be very careful if you notice you take on those biases
because of the industry we work in. Our industry is terrible at this
categorization and stereotype creation, and it shows. We're working on
making it better and this conversation is a good starting point.

Niki,

I couldn?t agree more. I get that a lot. ?Wait - you?re in marketing???? And yet, most of my upstream-only colleagues at HP will agree that I do as much if not more ?contributing? to OpenStack as any of them, (including my dear friend Monty). The OpenStack community has consumed my life (and much of my marketing budget) for the past 3 years. I devote countless hours to community building, as well as customer adoption of OpenStack, and unlike many other HP employees in Allison?s team (formerly Monty?s team) it?s not my actual job. So I?m more of an ?OpenStack volunteer? like many of our contributors who are not currently employed by a corporation. A large number of us community members do it in our ?spare time? because we?re passionate about OpenStack and community and it takes all of us to make this succeed. I personally devote 2 nights a month to run the OpenStack user group meetings for the SF Bay area (yes, our meetup runs every other Thursday!), I?ve written 2 books on OpenStack, made countless videos, flown to various regions of the globe to set up local user groups, regularly speak to customers about OpenStack adoption, and have spoken at numerous conferences all in the interest of promoting OpenStack technology. So yes, even ?Marketing? people add value to OpenStack. And yes, it?s VERY annoying every time I hear those comments, which unfortunately happen all too often!

Thanks for sharing your thoughts Niki. You are an extremely passionate and valuable member of our community and I thank you for all that you do! :)

Cheers,

> I have nothing against non-technical people, and I meant no offence, but I'm looking at it from a different point-of-view than you are. Maybe my view is skewed, as the majority of the men I met were technical, and it seemed that the majority of the women I met were not technical. I got the feeling that technical women were highly underrepresented at the summit. I don't know what the over-all statistics were for technical/non-technical male/female overall, but I just saw the women as a majority non-technical group, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it would leave me feeling that being a technical women puts me in much more of a minority than I thought. i.e. I was expecting to find women in a similar role to myself.

Same goes for non-tech, the marketing guy is not going to want to talk to the kernel engineer when talking about (e.g.) the newest distro, they'll just want to know about a feature at a high level, and not how many lines of code and what algorithms were used to implement the feature.

A few women in the room took offense to that statement, and I understood why. It was as though marketers were somehow less important and less valuable than contributors and developers. A woman in the audience stood up, walked to the mic, and asked folks to stop saying ?they thought I was in marketing like it?s a bad thing.? She was right.

I am very glad that the questions from the community has led to this open dialogue.  I would like to submit an abstract for Austin OpenStack on "The Many Ways We Contribute to OpenStack".  I was compelled to do a talk like this at the Linux Conference earlier this year as well because so much of the dominant conversation is around one form of contribution only and it does not recognize all the work that happens in community, marketing, legal, documentation, social media to make a project successful.  My slides and blog on this are here. http://itblog.sandisk.com/values-impact-inclusive-open-source-communities/ and it includes Anne Gentle as one woman of impact.  I did another similar blog on women at SanDisk who contribute to innovation throughout the company. That innovation does not just happen in engineering.  http://itblog.sandisk.com/innovation-at-sandisk-women-you-need-to-know/

I would love to interview women of OpenStack for this presentation and also feature you in the panel.    Ideas welcome.  Look for my request in the coming weeks.   Thank you for inspiring inclusion and speaking up.

Thank You,

Niki,

I couldn?t agree more. I get that a lot. ?Wait - you?re in marketing???? And yet, most of my upstream-only colleagues at HP will agree that I do as much if not more ?contributing? to OpenStack as any of them, (including my dear friend Monty). The OpenStack community has consumed my life (and much of my marketing budget) for the past 3 years. I devote countless hours to community building, as well as customer adoption of OpenStack, and unlike many other HP employees in Allison?s team (formerly Monty?s team) it?s not my actual job. So I?m more of an ?OpenStack volunteer? like many of our contributors who are not currently employed by a corporation. A large number of us community members do it in our ?spare time? because we?re passionate about OpenStack and community and it takes all of us to make this succeed. I personally devote 2 nights a month to run the OpenStack user group meetings for the SF Bay area (yes, our meetup runs every other Thursday!), I?ve written 2 books on OpenStack, made countless videos, flown to various regions of the globe to set up local user groups, regularly speak to customers about OpenStack adoption, and have spoken at numerous conferences all in the interest of promoting OpenStack technology. So yes, even ?Marketing? people add value to OpenStack. And yes, it?s VERY annoying every time I hear those comments, which unfortunately happen all too often!

Thanks for sharing your thoughts Niki. You are an extremely passionate and valuable member of our community and I thank you for all that you do! :)

Cheers,
Lisa

> I have nothing against non-technical people, and I meant no offence, but I'm looking at it from a different point-of-view than you are. Maybe my view is skewed, as the majority of the men I met were technical, and it seemed that the majority of the women I met were not technical. I got the feeling that technical women were highly underrepresented at the summit. I don't know what the over-all statistics were for technical/non-technical male/female overall, but I just saw the women as a majority non-technical group, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it would leave me feeling that being a technical women puts me in much more of a minority than I thought. i.e. I was expecting to find women in a similar role to myself.

I don't think the intend was to say that the SW developers are the only
real contributors (besides I personally don't think that SW developer is
the only technical role in the OpenStack community).

If I understand correctly the various reactions, it is a matter of
rephrasing the question to something like  "how many SW developers are
female developers?".  That is a valid question to me, and more generally
having statistics about the various roles that the women of OpenStack have
in the community is interesting.

Have to change the thread since I'm a word nerd. :)

The answer is more complex than you might imagine. We've used some scripts
since 2013 or so, with a gender-guessing algorithm based on first name. It
isn't very accurate for our community because it was using US census data
to match names to gender, for example. [1]

Using something like Stackalytics REST API and a Python script with again,
the gender guesser that I don't like, shows there are more unknown genders
than men, based on name guessing. [2]

Liberty:
females: 157
males: 870
unknown: 985

Kilo:
females: 135
males: 778
unknown: 829

I don't really like any of these counting devices because it's ignoring,
say, Asian and Indian first-name-gender-guessing, and diversity means
diversity across many viewpoints.

I'll also note that for me, event attendance is a poor counting device for
activity of women and minorities especially, since it can be more difficult
to achieve escape velocity for various reasons, caretaking, budgeting,
location proximity, shifting priorities, and so on.

I hope that info gives you a little more background. Please tell me if I'm
incorrect in any of the explanations. This is a good discussion, thanks for
having it.

Anne

Yes, so basically the interest to have those statistics is there but there
is no accurate way today of guessing the gender from a github profile.

Regarding the OS Summit Statistics, from what I understood from Claire
Massey's email is that we have the participants gender but not their role,
so in that case it is the role that is missing and has to be "guessed" (for
ex using the number of ATC badges to determine the number of code
contributors).

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] How many software devs?

Hi there,

As Anne just mentioned the Summit attendee demographics are not a comprehensive way to capture data points that fully represent the OpenStack community. Many active community members are unable to attend the Summits. 

The data that I previously shared was specific to women ATC attendees at the Tokyo Summit because Nithya?s original topic (at the bottom of this thread) specifically mentioned that people are inquiring how many women are contributing code to OpenStack and referenced the picture from the Tokyo Summit.  

However, if you are more broadly wanting to know the quantity of women Tokyo Summit attendees who have technical roles, whether or not they are contributing code and have the ATC designation, then we can pull that data for you. It will just take me some time to cull through, but we can do it.

All Tokyo Summit attendees who registered online were asked to provide their organizational role and select one or more of the following options. Many people selected more than one option.
 - Developer
 - OpenStack User
 - Operations / SysAdmin
 - CIO / CTO / IT Manager
 - Business Development / Marketing
 - CEO / Executive Leadership
 - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - Media
 - Other

I can cull through the Tokyo Summit data to share the percentages of women attendees who self identify with these categories. 

For reference, here is the breakdown of roles across all Tokyo Summit attendees (men and women combined):
 - 28%  - Developer 
 - 25%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 19%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect 
 - 11%  - Business Development / Marketing 
 - 10%  - CEO / CIO / IT Manager 
 - 7%    - Other 

Best,
Claire

Subject: [Women-of-openstack]  How many software devs?
Message-ID: <0078AE486081F642B4747581212AD05F01250A82@IRSMSX109.ger.corp.intel.com>

Maybe this could be of help: http://blog.namsor.com/api/ 
The API can determine gender with a high level of accuracy based on first and last name.
Who owns the gender guessing script at the moment? Maybe this can be incorporated into it.

Regards,
Emma

Hi there,

Here?s the breakdown of roles of women attendees at the Tokyo Summit:
 - 26%  - Developer 
 - 21%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 18%  - Other
 - 15%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect  
 - 14%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 6%    - CEO / CIO / IT Manager 
 
Best,
Claire

A few women in the room took offense to that statement, and I understood why. It was as though marketers were somehow less important and less valuable than contributors and developers. A woman in the audience stood up, walked to the mic, and asked folks to stop saying ?they thought I was in marketing like it?s a bad thing.? She was right. That exchange made me realize that subconscious bias exists even amongst women in the same group.

It's quite accurate, as I came up with both genders. :)

Obviously, this is going to struggle a bit with those somewhat ambiguous
names, along with A Boy Named Sue.

Sorry, my sense of humor is this way 24/7. It has nothing to do with lack
of coffee.

Those 38 unknown are based on non ascii characters in the name, and I didn't deal with it.

Unfortunately, it took a little longer than the original script

Claire ? thanks very much for these #s.

Some broad and quick observations:

-          It seems to be consistent for women with the general population for developer, architect and CEO category - +/- 4%;

-          But I am intrigued that more women claim the other category by almost 3 times.  I wonder why? And what it covers.

-          My belief is that with emerging open source projects, yes OpenStack can still be considered emerging compared to more mature projects like Linux, there is bound to be more BD, Marketing, Community to create awareness, community.    Yes, Lot more women in this category than the general #.  Besides, OpenStack covers so much ground and is a framework that is ideal for ecosystem building and partnerships which also explains the BD/Mktg #.

-          Further many operators are  users and developers.  I wonder which way they categorize themselves when they select their breakdown.   No doubt we are under-represented here.

Hi there,

Here?s the breakdown of roles of women attendees at the Tokyo Summit:
 - 26%  - Developer
 - 21%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 18%  - Other
 - 15%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - 14%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 6%    - CEO / CIO / IT Manager

Best,
Claire

Hi there,

As Anne just mentioned the Summit attendee demographics are not a comprehensive way to capture data points that fully represent the OpenStack community. Many active community members are unable to attend the Summits.

The data that I previously shared was specific to women ATC attendees at the Tokyo Summit because Nithya?s original topic (at the bottom of this thread) specifically mentioned that people are inquiring how many women are contributing code to OpenStack and referenced the picture from the Tokyo Summit.

However, if you are more broadly wanting to know the quantity of women Tokyo Summit attendees who have technical roles, whether or not they are contributing code and have the ATC designation, then we can pull that data for you. It will just take me some time to cull through, but we can do it.

All Tokyo Summit attendees who registered online were asked to provide their organizational role and select one or more of the following options. Many people selected more than one option.
 - Developer
 - OpenStack User
 - Operations / SysAdmin
 - CIO / CTO / IT Manager
 - Business Development / Marketing
 - CEO / Executive Leadership
 - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - Media
 - Other

I can cull through the Tokyo Summit data to share the percentages of women attendees who self identify with these categories.

For reference, here is the breakdown of roles across all Tokyo Summit attendees (men and women combined):
 - 28%  - Developer
 - 25%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 19%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - 11%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 10%  - CEO / CIO / IT Manager
 - 7%    - Other

Best,
Claire

Yes, so basically the interest to have those statistics is there but there is no accurate way today of guessing the gender from a github profile.

Regarding the OS Summit Statistics, from what I understood from Claire Massey's email is that we have the participants gender but not their role, so in that case it is the role that is missing and has to be "guessed" (for ex using the number of ATC badges to determine the number of code contributors).

If I understand correctly the various reactions, it is a matter of rephrasing the question to something like  "how many SW developers are female developers?".  That is a valid question to me, and more generally having statistics about the various roles that the women of OpenStack have in the community is interesting.

The answer is more complex than you might imagine. We've used some scripts since 2013 or so, with a gender-guessing algorithm based on first name. It isn't very accurate for our community because it was using US census data to match names to gender, for example. [1]

Using something like Stackalytics REST API and a Python script with again, the gender guesser that I don't like, shows there are more unknown genders than men, based on name guessing. [2]

Liberty:
females: 157
males: 870
unknown: 985

Kilo:
females: 135
males: 778
unknown: 829

I don't really like any of these counting devices because it's ignoring, say, Asian and Indian first-name-gender-guessing, and diversity means diversity across many viewpoints.

I'll also note that for me, event attendance is a poor counting device for activity of women and minorities especially, since it can be more difficult to achieve escape velocity for various reasons, caretaking, budgeting, location proximity, shifting priorities, and so on.

I hope that info gives you a little more background. Please tell me if I'm incorrect in any of the explanations. This is a good discussion, thanks for having it.

I got the feeling that technical women were highly underrepresented at the summit. I don't know what the over-all statistics were for technical/non-technical male/female overall, but I just saw the women as a majority non-technical group, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it would leave me feeling that being a technical women puts me in much more of a minority than I thought. i.e. I was expecting to find women in a similar role to myself.

It might also be to do with the fact that I expected a lot more technical people overall, as that is where I'm coming from, working in a technical team in a large company, where marketing and other non-technical people are kept separate to a great extent.

TLDR; My previous experience does not include a huge amount of collaboration with non-tech people, which skewed my expectations.


Glad you expanded upon your experiences. Let me give you some more perspective if I may.

There's good reason to be concerned about some sort of call-out in amount of technical-ness of any individual contributor. We're unfortunately in an industry where this practice continues to shove women in to a category that's considered "lesser." I'd recommend this article:
https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/c-is-manly-python-is-for-n00bs-how-false-stereotypes-turn-into-technical-truths

Pull quotes that really spoke to me:
  * "A major reason to eradicate these false stereotypes is that they perpetuate biases against women."
  * "While those on the outside are still struggling to prove themselves, the technically privileged have gone ahead to determine what the software that runs our lives should look like."
  * "Judgments about language use, despite being far from ?objective? or ?technical,? set up a hierarchy among programmers that systematically privileges certain groups."

I've been more aware of the loss of power or privilege by choosing to be in an "other" category since my focus is documentation. It happens to be highly technical, but people often overlook or even look down upon it as a contribution. Same for "oh you're a database administrator" or "oh, you are a web developer." Be very careful if you notice you take on those biases because of the industry we work in. Our industry is terrible at this categorization and stereotype creation, and it shows. We're working on making it better and this conversation is a good starting point.

Anne


In general:
Tech people engage with tech people as they know the product on a different level to non-technical people. Same goes for non-tech, the marketing guy is not going to want to talk to the kernel engineer when talking about (e.g.) the newest distro, they'll just want to know about a feature at a high level, and not how many lines of code and what algorithms were used to implement the feature.

To address the problem of people being disappointed at meeting a marketing person at a booth:
    A technical person is going to want to talk tech, and will be expecting technical person (as well as marketing) to be available to answer their technical questions. I'm not saying a marketing person wouldn't be able to answer these, but the tech person would be better qualified to discuss the highly technical stuff, as it would be their area of expertise.

So don't be offended if I want to talk tech with other technical people, and was disappointed that I didn't find as many as I was expecting in the group. Any non-technical person would feel lost in a room of engineers.

Emma

This bums me out. Maybe I?m taking this personally, but being ?disappointed" and following that with ?at least 50% of the women I met were in non-technical roles? makes it seem like women (like myself) are somehow less valuable or important because we?re not technical contributors. Perhaps that is not your intent. Nevertheless, I wanted to share some thoughts on this subject, as it?s come up quite a bit.

During a past summit, someone made a comment in a panel that they were ?offended? that someone came to the booth and thought they were ?in marketing.? A few women in the room took offense to that statement, and I understood why. It was as though marketers were somehow less important and less valuable than contributors and developers. A woman in the audience stood up, walked to the mic, and asked folks to stop saying ?they thought I was in marketing like it?s a bad thing.? She was right. That exchange made me realize that subconscious bias exists even amongst women in the same group.

As women, we should support each other!

If it weren?t for the brilliant women (and men) of OpenStack who share their expertise around public relations, social media, marketing, business development, branding, copywriting, communications, analyst relations, event planning, presentation authoring/coaching, and probably a whole lot of other stuff that I?m probably forgetting, what would OpenStack look like? There would be no summit. There would be no Women of OpenStack events. There would be no SuperUser magazine or newsletter.There would be no ?We Are OpenStack? campaign. OpenStack would NOT EXIST.

At then end of each day, we?re all human. We all have different skills, different talents, and different abilities. The cool part is that people from all around the globe are building something that is fundamentally changing humanity< something bigger than ourselves. And while the code and docs are created by technical contributors, the other side of OpenStack keeps that foundation strong and vibrant and growing. And that?s pretty cool.

Apologies if this offended anyone. That definitely was not my intent. My intent is to help us be more inclusive and embrace diversity< no matter what is printed on your badge.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] How many software devs?
In-Reply-To: <D627DF54-3F9D-4109-B0BC-C3F43700B12B@openstack.org>

Message-ID: <CAA14+99YFVRNRvDhb2WkJdKUjqhSTxRA2s_wn_EreutCnfQmug@mail.gmail.com>

I can't remember how I classified myself on the survey. It might have been
as "Other", though I pretty much meet ALL of these with my various roles,
which goes to the earlier point that business, operational, and other roles
can in fact be quite technical. In fact, I was a marketing executive for
years before I started doing software development. I simply got tired of
being told, "No, it can't be done." by my VP of Engineering.

I actually tend to go out of my way to NOT classify myself as a developer,
these days. Any coding I do is for personal fulfillment and to keep my
skills sharp. I believe it also helps me to cut through the hype on a lot
of technologies.

Most of the women I know in my industry would tend to full this
classification as they also tend to fill multiple buckets.

All I'm suggesting is that statistics are useful to a point. Certainly
capturing the ratio of women to men is helpful, especially when considering
the issue of diversity. The other demographic breakdowns seem less helpful
and more in the category of nice to know how people see themselves.

For example, as we move forward, I find that the amount of development that
actually goes into automating test environments suggests that many in QA
would probably meet the classification of a developer.  And I know plenty
of software engineers who woefully lag in technical expertise compared with
my Ops friends, who also do some development.

It seems to me that it might continue to be more useful to see the
comparisons of women vs. men in the  various classifications. I see the
margin is quite large for developers-- 25:262, or 9.5%. It's nice to see we
moved up a percentage point from 17% to 18% participation going from Kilo
to Liberty. But I would like to see if women dominate in any of the
categories such as marketing, business, ops, etc., or whether those margins
are much closer.

This information isn't just useful for OpenStack. The community is so large
and so unique that getting this kind of comparative data could be quite
useful in many studies.

I'm sure many of you have already considered this.

Best,

Ash

Like Ashlee I most likely did not classify myself as a developer as I?m not one professionally though I did contribute code to Liberty. For Mitaka so far I?ve submitted a doc fix for a project and am looking at helping with the RST conversions taking place under the docs group and we?ll see what else comes along including more code.

Thanks,

Amy

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] How many software devs?

Claire ? thanks very much for these #s.

Some broad and quick observations:

-          It seems to be consistent for women with the general population for developer, architect and CEO category - +/- 4%;

-          But I am intrigued that more women claim the other category by almost 3 times.  I wonder why? And what it covers.

-          My belief is that with emerging open source projects, yes OpenStack can still be considered emerging compared to more mature projects like Linux, there is bound to be more BD, Marketing, Community to create awareness, community.    Yes, Lot more women in this category than the general #.  Besides, OpenStack covers so much ground and is a framework that is ideal for ecosystem building and partnerships which also explains the BD/Mktg #.

-          Further many operators are  users and developers.  I wonder which way they categorize themselves when they select their breakdown.   No doubt we are under-represented here.

 - 26%  - Developer
 - 21%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 18%  - Other
 - 15%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect

Hi there,

As Anne just mentioned the Summit attendee demographics are not a comprehensive way to capture data points that fully represent the OpenStack community. Many active community members are unable to attend the Summits.

The data that I previously shared was specific to women ATC attendees at the Tokyo Summit because Nithya?s original topic (at the bottom of this thread) specifically mentioned that people are inquiring how many women are contributing code to OpenStack and referenced the picture from the Tokyo Summit.

However, if you are more broadly wanting to know the quantity of women Tokyo Summit attendees who have technical roles, whether or not they are contributing code and have the ATC designation, then we can pull that data for you. It will just take me some time to cull through, but we can do it.

All Tokyo Summit attendees who registered online were asked to provide their organizational role and select one or more of the following options. Many people selected more than one option.
 - Developer
 - OpenStack User
 - Operations / SysAdmin
 - CIO / CTO / IT Manager
 - Business Development / Marketing
 - CEO / Executive Leadership
 - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - Media
 - Other

I can cull through the Tokyo Summit data to share the percentages of women attendees who self identify with these categories.

For reference, here is the breakdown of roles across all Tokyo Summit attendees (men and women combined):
 - 28%  - Developer
 - 25%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 19%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - 11%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 10%  - CEO / CIO / IT Manager
 - 7%    - Other

Yes, so basically the interest to have those statistics is there but there is no accurate way today of guessing the gender from a github profile.

Regarding the OS Summit Statistics, from what I understood from Claire Massey's email is that we have the participants gender but not their role, so in that case it is the role that is missing and has to be "guessed" (for ex using the number of ATC badges to determine the number of code contributors).

I don't think the intend was to say that the SW developers are the only real contributors (besides I personally don't think that SW developer is the only technical role in the OpenStack community).

If I understand correctly the various reactions, it is a matter of rephrasing the question to something like  "how many SW developers are female developers?".  That is a valid question to me, and more generally having statistics about the various roles that the women of OpenStack have in the community is interesting.

The answer is more complex than you might imagine. We've used some scripts since 2013 or so, with a gender-guessing algorithm based on first name. It isn't very accurate for our community because it was using US census data to match names to gender, for example. [1]

Using something like Stackalytics REST API and a Python script with again, the gender guesser that I don't like, shows there are more unknown genders than men, based on name guessing. [2]

Liberty:
females: 157
males: 870
unknown: 985

Kilo:
females: 135
males: 778
unknown: 829

I don't really like any of these counting devices because it's ignoring, say, Asian and Indian first-name-gender-guessing, and diversity means diversity across many viewpoints.

I'll also note that for me, event attendance is a poor counting device for activity of women and minorities especially, since it can be more difficult to achieve escape velocity for various reasons, caretaking, budgeting, location proximity, shifting priorities, and so on.

I hope that info gives you a little more background. Please tell me if I'm incorrect in any of the explanations. This is a good discussion, thanks for having it.

I have nothing against non-technical people, and I meant no offence, but I'm looking at it from a different point-of-view than you are. Maybe my view is skewed, as the majority of the men I met were technical, and it seemed that the majority of the women I met were not technical. I got the feeling that technical women were highly underrepresented at the summit. I don't know what the over-all statistics were for technical/non-technical male/female overall, but I just saw the women as a majority non-technical group, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it would leave me feeling that being a technical women puts me in much more of a minority than I thought. i.e. I was expecting to find women in a similar role to myself.

It might also be to do with the fact that I expected a lot more technical people overall, as that is where I'm coming from, working in a technical team in a large company, where marketing and other non-technical people are kept separate to a great extent.

TLDR; My previous experience does not include a huge amount of collaboration with non-tech people, which skewed my expectations.


Glad you expanded upon your experiences. Let me give you some more perspective if I may.

There's good reason to be concerned about some sort of call-out in amount of technical-ness of any individual contributor. We're unfortunately in an industry where this practice continues to shove women in to a category that's considered "lesser." I'd recommend this article:
https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/c-is-manly-python-is-for-n00bs-how-false-stereotypes-turn-into-technical-truths

Pull quotes that really spoke to me:
  * "A major reason to eradicate these false stereotypes is that they perpetuate biases against women."
  * "While those on the outside are still struggling to prove themselves, the technically privileged have gone ahead to determine what the software that runs our lives should look like."
  * "Judgments about language use, despite being far from ?objective? or ?technical,? set up a hierarchy among programmers that systematically privileges certain groups."

I've been more aware of the loss of power or privilege by choosing to be in an "other" category since my focus is documentation. It happens to be highly technical, but people often overlook or even look down upon it as a contribution. Same for "oh you're a database administrator" or "oh, you are a web developer." Be very careful if you notice you take on those biases because of the industry we work in. Our industry is terrible at this categorization and stereotype creation, and it shows. We're working on making it better and this conversation is a good starting point.

Anne


In general:
Tech people engage with tech people as they know the product on a different level to non-technical people. Same goes for non-tech, the marketing guy is not going to want to talk to the kernel engineer when talking about (e.g.) the newest distro, they'll just want to know about a feature at a high level, and not how many lines of code and what algorithms were used to implement the feature.

To address the problem of people being disappointed at meeting a marketing person at a booth:
    A technical person is going to want to talk tech, and will be expecting technical person (as well as marketing) to be available to answer their technical questions. I'm not saying a marketing person wouldn't be able to answer these, but the tech person would be better qualified to discuss the highly technical stuff, as it would be their area of expertise.

So don't be offended if I want to talk tech with other technical people, and was disappointed that I didn't find as many as I was expecting in the group. Any non-technical person would feel lost in a room of engineers.

Regards,
Emma

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] Meeting today

This bums me out. Maybe I?m taking this personally, but being ?disappointed" and following that with ?at least 50% of the women I met were in non-technical roles? makes it seem like women (like myself) are somehow less valuable or important because we?re not technical contributors. Perhaps that is not your intent. Nevertheless, I wanted to share some thoughts on this subject, as it?s come up quite a bit.

During a past summit, someone made a comment in a panel that they were ?offended? that someone came to the booth and thought they were ?in marketing.? A few women in the room took offense to that statement, and I understood why. It was as though marketers were somehow less important and less valuable than contributors and developers. A woman in the audience stood up, walked to the mic, and asked folks to stop saying ?they thought I was in marketing like it?s a bad thing.? She was right. That exchange made me realize that subconscious bias exists even amongst women in the same group.

As women, we should support each other!

If it weren?t for the brilliant women (and men) of OpenStack who share their expertise around public relations, social media, marketing, business development, branding, copywriting, communications, analyst relations, event planning, presentation authoring/coaching, and probably a whole lot of other stuff that I?m probably forgetting, what would OpenStack look like? There would be no summit. There would be no Women of OpenStack events. There would be no SuperUser magazine or newsletter.There would be no ?We Are OpenStack? campaign. OpenStack would NOT EXIST.

At then end of each day, we?re all human. We all have different skills, different talents, and different abilities. The cool part is that people from all around the globe are building something that is fundamentally changing humanity< something bigger than ourselves. And while the code and docs are created by technical contributors, the other side of OpenStack keeps that foundation strong and vibrant and growing. And that?s pretty cool.

Apologies if this offended anyone. That definitely was not my intent. My intent is to help us be more inclusive and embrace diversity< no matter what is printed on your badge.

Yes, so basically the interest to have those statistics is there but there is no accurate way today of guessing the gender from a github profile.

Regarding the OS Summit Statistics, from what I understood from Claire Massey's email is that we have the participants gender but not their role, so in that case it is the role that is missing and has to be "guessed" (for ex using the number of ATC badges to determine the number of code contributors).

I don't think the intend was to say that the SW developers are the only real contributors (besides I personally don't think that SW developer is the only technical role in the OpenStack community).

If I understand correctly the various reactions, it is a matter of rephrasing the question to something like  "how many SW developers are female developers?".  That is a valid question to me, and more generally having statistics about the various roles that the women of OpenStack have in the community is interesting.

The answer is more complex than you might imagine. We've used some scripts since 2013 or so, with a gender-guessing algorithm based on first name. It isn't very accurate for our community because it was using US census data to match names to gender, for example. [1]

Using something like Stackalytics REST API and a Python script with again, the gender guesser that I don't like, shows there are more unknown genders than men, based on name guessing. [2]

Liberty:
females: 157
males: 870
unknown: 985

Kilo:
females: 135
males: 778
unknown: 829

I don't really like any of these counting devices because it's ignoring, say, Asian and Indian first-name-gender-guessing, and diversity means diversity across many viewpoints.

I'll also note that for me, event attendance is a poor counting device for activity of women and minorities especially, since it can be more difficult to achieve escape velocity for various reasons, caretaking, budgeting, location proximity, shifting priorities, and so on.

I hope that info gives you a little more background. Please tell me if I'm incorrect in any of the explanations. This is a good discussion, thanks for having it.

I have nothing against non-technical people, and I meant no offence, but I'm looking at it from a different point-of-view than you are. Maybe my view is skewed, as the majority of the men I met were technical, and it seemed that the majority of the women I met were not technical. I got the feeling that technical women were highly underrepresented at the summit. I don't know what the over-all statistics were for technical/non-technical male/female overall, but I just saw the women as a majority non-technical group, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it would leave me feeling that being a technical women puts me in much more of a minority than I thought. i.e. I was expecting to find women in a similar role to myself.

It might also be to do with the fact that I expected a lot more technical people overall, as that is where I'm coming from, working in a technical team in a large company, where marketing and other non-technical people are kept separate to a great extent.

TLDR; My previous experience does not include a huge amount of collaboration with non-tech people, which skewed my expectations.


Glad you expanded upon your experiences. Let me give you some more perspective if I may.

There's good reason to be concerned about some sort of call-out in amount of technical-ness of any individual contributor. We're unfortunately in an industry where this practice continues to shove women in to a category that's considered "lesser." I'd recommend this article:
https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/c-is-manly-python-is-for-n00bs-how-false-stereotypes-turn-into-technical-truths

Pull quotes that really spoke to me:
  * "A major reason to eradicate these false stereotypes is that they perpetuate biases against women."
  * "While those on the outside are still struggling to prove themselves, the technically privileged have gone ahead to determine what the software that runs our lives should look like."
  * "Judgments about language use, despite being far from ?objective? or ?technical,? set up a hierarchy among programmers that systematically privileges certain groups."

I've been more aware of the loss of power or privilege by choosing to be in an "other" category since my focus is documentation. It happens to be highly technical, but people often overlook or even look down upon it as a contribution. Same for "oh you're a database administrator" or "oh, you are a web developer." Be very careful if you notice you take on those biases because of the industry we work in. Our industry is terrible at this categorization and stereotype creation, and it shows. We're working on making it better and this conversation is a good starting point.

Anne


In general:
Tech people engage with tech people as they know the product on a different level to non-technical people. Same goes for non-tech, the marketing guy is not going to want to talk to the kernel engineer when talking about (e.g.) the newest distro, they'll just want to know about a feature at a high level, and not how many lines of code and what algorithms were used to implement the feature.

To address the problem of people being disappointed at meeting a marketing person at a booth:
    A technical person is going to want to talk tech, and will be expecting technical person (as well as marketing) to be available to answer their technical questions. I'm not saying a marketing person wouldn't be able to answer these, but the tech person would be better qualified to discuss the highly technical stuff, as it would be their area of expertise.

So don't be offended if I want to talk tech with other technical people, and was disappointed that I didn't find as many as I was expecting in the group. Any non-technical person would feel lost in a room of engineers.

Emma

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] Meeting today

This bums me out. Maybe I?m taking this personally, but being ?disappointed" and following that with ?at least 50% of the women I met were in non-technical roles? makes it seem like women (like myself) are somehow less valuable or important because we?re not technical contributors. Perhaps that is not your intent. Nevertheless, I wanted to share some thoughts on this subject, as it?s come up quite a bit.

During a past summit, someone made a comment in a panel that they were ?offended? that someone came to the booth and thought they were ?in marketing.? A few women in the room took offense to that statement, and I understood why. It was as though marketers were somehow less important and less valuable than contributors and developers. A woman in the audience stood up, walked to the mic, and asked folks to stop saying ?they thought I was in marketing like it?s a bad thing.? She was right. That exchange made me realize that subconscious bias exists even amongst women in the same group.

As women, we should support each other!

If it weren?t for the brilliant women (and men) of OpenStack who share their expertise around public relations, social media, marketing, business development, branding, copywriting, communications, analyst relations, event planning, presentation authoring/coaching, and probably a whole lot of other stuff that I?m probably forgetting, what would OpenStack look like? There would be no summit. There would be no Women of OpenStack events. There would be no SuperUser magazine or newsletter.There would be no ?We Are OpenStack? campaign. OpenStack would NOT EXIST.

At then end of each day, we?re all human. We all have different skills, different talents, and different abilities. The cool part is that people from all around the globe are building something that is fundamentally changing humanity< something bigger than ourselves. And while the code and docs are created by technical contributors, the other side of OpenStack keeps that foundation strong and vibrant and growing. And that?s pretty cool.

Apologies if this offended anyone. That definitely was not my intent. My intent is to help us be more inclusive and embrace diversity< no matter what is printed on your badge.

Every other week seems very reasonable all around. My only pause is that
when biweekly meetings get cancelled for whatever reason, you can easily go
4 - 6 weeks without meeting. To counter that, I have frequently scheduled a
recurring meeting to be held weekly and then cancelled once (or twice) a
month in advance of the event if there isn't enough material to warrant the
agenda and/or there is a holiday or other event that means people won't be
able to attend.

So sorry to have missed yesterday's meeting, by the way! Lost track of the
time and missed the calendar invite in the flood of email catching up post
weekend.

Cheers and have a great week, all,

Rainya

Folks -
Biweekly seems to feel about right.  Keeps the momentum, with out 
burdening some very busy people.  Near the SUmmit we would move to 
weekly.  We can continue to us my teleconference number.

Could someone from the Foundation respond to the Twitter question on how many of the women attendees were developers as that is the closest info we have on how many are ATC.    Please see tweet below.   Answer is best coming from the foundation and including these 2 ladies who asked.

Thanks

Hi there,

Here?s the breakdown of roles of women attendees at the Tokyo Summit:
 - 26%  - Developer
 - 21%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 18%  - Other
 - 15%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - 14%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 6%    - CEO / CIO / IT Manager

Best,

Hi there,

As Anne just mentioned the Summit attendee demographics are not a comprehensive way to capture data points that fully represent the OpenStack community. Many active community members are unable to attend the Summits.

The data that I previously shared was specific to women ATC attendees at the Tokyo Summit because Nithya?s original topic (at the bottom of this thread) specifically mentioned that people are inquiring how many women are contributing code to OpenStack and referenced the picture from the Tokyo Summit.

However, if you are more broadly wanting to know the quantity of women Tokyo Summit attendees who have technical roles, whether or not they are contributing code and have the ATC designation, then we can pull that data for you. It will just take me some time to cull through, but we can do it.

All Tokyo Summit attendees who registered online were asked to provide their organizational role and select one or more of the following options. Many people selected more than one option.
 - Developer
 - OpenStack User
 - Operations / SysAdmin
 - CIO / CTO / IT Manager
 - Business Development / Marketing
 - CEO / Executive Leadership
 - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - Media
 - Other

I can cull through the Tokyo Summit data to share the percentages of women attendees who self identify with these categories.

For reference, here is the breakdown of roles across all Tokyo Summit attendees (men and women combined):
 - 28%  - Developer
 - 25%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 19%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - 11%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 10%  - CEO / CIO / IT Manager
 - 7%    - Other

Best,
Claire

Yes, so basically the interest to have those statistics is there but there is no accurate way today of guessing the gender from a github profile.

Regarding the OS Summit Statistics, from what I understood from Claire Massey's email is that we have the participants gender but not their role, so in that case it is the role that is missing and has to be "guessed" (for ex using the number of ATC badges to determine the number of code contributors).

I don't think the intend was to say that the SW developers are the only real contributors (besides I personally don't think that SW developer is the only technical role in the OpenStack community).

If I understand correctly the various reactions, it is a matter of rephrasing the question to something like  "how many SW developers are female developers?".  That is a valid question to me, and more generally having statistics about the various roles that the women of OpenStack have in the community is interesting.

The answer is more complex than you might imagine. We've used some scripts since 2013 or so, with a gender-guessing algorithm based on first name. It isn't very accurate for our community because it was using US census data to match names to gender, for example. [1]

Using something like Stackalytics REST API and a Python script with again, the gender guesser that I don't like, shows there are more unknown genders than men, based on name guessing. [2]

Liberty:
females: 157
males: 870
unknown: 985

Kilo:
females: 135
males: 778
unknown: 829

I don't really like any of these counting devices because it's ignoring, say, Asian and Indian first-name-gender-guessing, and diversity means diversity across many viewpoints.

I'll also note that for me, event attendance is a poor counting device for activity of women and minorities especially, since it can be more difficult to achieve escape velocity for various reasons, caretaking, budgeting, location proximity, shifting priorities, and so on.

I hope that info gives you a little more background. Please tell me if I'm incorrect in any of the explanations. This is a good discussion, thanks for having it.

I have nothing against non-technical people, and I meant no offence, but I'm looking at it from a different point-of-view than you are. Maybe my view is skewed, as the majority of the men I met were technical, and it seemed that the majority of the women I met were not technical. I got the feeling that technical women were highly underrepresented at the summit. I don't know what the over-all statistics were for technical/non-technical male/female overall, but I just saw the women as a majority non-technical group, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it would leave me feeling that being a technical women puts me in much more of a minority than I thought. i.e. I was expecting to find women in a similar role to myself.

It might also be to do with the fact that I expected a lot more technical people overall, as that is where I'm coming from, working in a technical team in a large company, where marketing and other non-technical people are kept separate to a great extent.

TLDR; My previous experience does not include a huge amount of collaboration with non-tech people, which skewed my expectations.


Glad you expanded upon your experiences. Let me give you some more perspective if I may.

There's good reason to be concerned about some sort of call-out in amount of technical-ness of any individual contributor. We're unfortunately in an industry where this practice continues to shove women in to a category that's considered "lesser." I'd recommend this article:
https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/c-is-manly-python-is-for-n00bs-how-false-stereotypes-turn-into-technical-truths

Pull quotes that really spoke to me:
  * "A major reason to eradicate these false stereotypes is that they perpetuate biases against women."
  * "While those on the outside are still struggling to prove themselves, the technically privileged have gone ahead to determine what the software that runs our lives should look like."
  * "Judgments about language use, despite being far from ?objective? or ?technical,? set up a hierarchy among programmers that systematically privileges certain groups."

I've been more aware of the loss of power or privilege by choosing to be in an "other" category since my focus is documentation. It happens to be highly technical, but people often overlook or even look down upon it as a contribution. Same for "oh you're a database administrator" or "oh, you are a web developer." Be very careful if you notice you take on those biases because of the industry we work in. Our industry is terrible at this categorization and stereotype creation, and it shows. We're working on making it better and this conversation is a good starting point.

Anne


In general:
Tech people engage with tech people as they know the product on a different level to non-technical people. Same goes for non-tech, the marketing guy is not going to want to talk to the kernel engineer when talking about (e.g.) the newest distro, they'll just want to know about a feature at a high level, and not how many lines of code and what algorithms were used to implement the feature.

To address the problem of people being disappointed at meeting a marketing person at a booth:
    A technical person is going to want to talk tech, and will be expecting technical person (as well as marketing) to be available to answer their technical questions. I'm not saying a marketing person wouldn't be able to answer these, but the tech person would be better qualified to discuss the highly technical stuff, as it would be their area of expertise.

So don't be offended if I want to talk tech with other technical people, and was disappointed that I didn't find as many as I was expecting in the group. Any non-technical person would feel lost in a room of engineers.

Regards,
Emma

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] Meeting today

This bums me out. Maybe I?m taking this personally, but being ?disappointed" and following that with ?at least 50% of the women I met were in non-technical roles? makes it seem like women (like myself) are somehow less valuable or important because we?re not technical contributors. Perhaps that is not your intent. Nevertheless, I wanted to share some thoughts on this subject, as it?s come up quite a bit.

During a past summit, someone made a comment in a panel that they were ?offended? that someone came to the booth and thought they were ?in marketing.? A few women in the room took offense to that statement, and I understood why. It was as though marketers were somehow less important and less valuable than contributors and developers. A woman in the audience stood up, walked to the mic, and asked folks to stop saying ?they thought I was in marketing like it?s a bad thing.? She was right. That exchange made me realize that subconscious bias exists even amongst women in the same group.

As women, we should support each other!

If it weren?t for the brilliant women (and men) of OpenStack who share their expertise around public relations, social media, marketing, business development, branding, copywriting, communications, analyst relations, event planning, presentation authoring/coaching, and probably a whole lot of other stuff that I?m probably forgetting, what would OpenStack look like? There would be no summit. There would be no Women of OpenStack events. There would be no SuperUser magazine or newsletter.There would be no ?We Are OpenStack? campaign. OpenStack would NOT EXIST.

At then end of each day, we?re all human. We all have different skills, different talents, and different abilities. The cool part is that people from all around the globe are building something that is fundamentally changing humanity< something bigger than ourselves. And while the code and docs are created by technical contributors, the other side of OpenStack keeps that foundation strong and vibrant and growing. And that?s pretty cool.

Apologies if this offended anyone. That definitely was not my intent. My intent is to help us be more inclusive and embrace diversity< no matter what is printed on your badge.

I?ve replied to this one, running the improved gender classifying script [1]

FYI It?s approximately a 430/1550 female/male split for Liberty.

Claire Massey

Could someone from the Foundation respond to the Twitter question on how many of the women attendees were developers as that is the closest info we have on how many are ATC.    Please see tweet below.   Answer is best coming from the foundation and including these 2 ladies who asked.

Thanks

Hi there,

Here?s the breakdown of roles of women attendees at the Tokyo Summit:
 - 26%  - Developer
 - 21%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 18%  - Other
 - 15%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - 14%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 6%    - CEO / CIO / IT Manager

Best,
Claire

Hi there,

As Anne just mentioned the Summit attendee demographics are not a comprehensive way to capture data points that fully represent the OpenStack community. Many active community members are unable to attend the Summits.

The data that I previously shared was specific to women ATC attendees at the Tokyo Summit because Nithya?s original topic (at the bottom of this thread) specifically mentioned that people are inquiring how many women are contributing code to OpenStack and referenced the picture from the Tokyo Summit.

However, if you are more broadly wanting to know the quantity of women Tokyo Summit attendees who have technical roles, whether or not they are contributing code and have the ATC designation, then we can pull that data for you. It will just take me some time to cull through, but we can do it.

All Tokyo Summit attendees who registered online were asked to provide their organizational role and select one or more of the following options. Many people selected more than one option.
 - Developer
 - OpenStack User
 - Operations / SysAdmin
 - CIO / CTO / IT Manager
 - Business Development / Marketing
 - CEO / Executive Leadership
 - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - Media
 - Other

I can cull through the Tokyo Summit data to share the percentages of women attendees who self identify with these categories.

For reference, here is the breakdown of roles across all Tokyo Summit attendees (men and women combined):
 - 28%  - Developer
 - 25%  - Operator / User / Operations SysAdmin
 - 19%  - Product Strategy / Management / Architect
 - 11%  - Business Development / Marketing
 - 10%  - CEO / CIO / IT Manager
 - 7%    - Other

Best,
Claire

Yes, so basically the interest to have those statistics is there but there is no accurate way today of guessing the gender from a github profile.

Regarding the OS Summit Statistics, from what I understood from Claire Massey's email is that we have the participants gender but not their role, so in that case it is the role that is missing and has to be "guessed" (for ex using the number of ATC badges to determine the number of code contributors).

I don't think the intend was to say that the SW developers are the only real contributors (besides I personally don't think that SW developer is the only technical role in the OpenStack community).

If I understand correctly the various reactions, it is a matter of rephrasing the question to something like  "how many SW developers are female developers?".  That is a valid question to me, and more generally having statistics about the various roles that the women of OpenStack have in the community is interesting.

The answer is more complex than you might imagine. We've used some scripts since 2013 or so, with a gender-guessing algorithm based on first name. It isn't very accurate for our community because it was using US census data to match names to gender, for example. [1]

Using something like Stackalytics REST API and a Python script with again, the gender guesser that I don't like, shows there are more unknown genders than men, based on name guessing. [2]

Liberty:
females: 157
males: 870
unknown: 985

Kilo:
females: 135
males: 778
unknown: 829

I don't really like any of these counting devices because it's ignoring, say, Asian and Indian first-name-gender-guessing, and diversity means diversity across many viewpoints.

I'll also note that for me, event attendance is a poor counting device for activity of women and minorities especially, since it can be more difficult to achieve escape velocity for various reasons, caretaking, budgeting, location proximity, shifting priorities, and so on.

I hope that info gives you a little more background. Please tell me if I'm incorrect in any of the explanations. This is a good discussion, thanks for having it.

I have nothing against non-technical people, and I meant no offence, but I'm looking at it from a different point-of-view than you are. Maybe my view is skewed, as the majority of the men I met were technical, and it seemed that the majority of the women I met were not technical. I got the feeling that technical women were highly underrepresented at the summit. I don't know what the over-all statistics were for technical/non-technical male/female overall, but I just saw the women as a majority non-technical group, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it would leave me feeling that being a technical women puts me in much more of a minority than I thought. i.e. I was expecting to find women in a similar role to myself.

It might also be to do with the fact that I expected a lot more technical people overall, as that is where I'm coming from, working in a technical team in a large company, where marketing and other non-technical people are kept separate to a great extent.

TLDR; My previous experience does not include a huge amount of collaboration with non-tech people, which skewed my expectations.


Glad you expanded upon your experiences. Let me give you some more perspective if I may.

There's good reason to be concerned about some sort of call-out in amount of technical-ness of any individual contributor. We're unfortunately in an industry where this practice continues to shove women in to a category that's considered "lesser." I'd recommend this article:
https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/c-is-manly-python-is-for-n00bs-how-false-stereotypes-turn-into-technical-truths

Pull quotes that really spoke to me:
  * "A major reason to eradicate these false stereotypes is that they perpetuate biases against women."
  * "While those on the outside are still struggling to prove themselves, the technically privileged have gone ahead to determine what the software that runs our lives should look like."
  * "Judgments about language use, despite being far from ?objective? or ?technical,? set up a hierarchy among programmers that systematically privileges certain groups."

I've been more aware of the loss of power or privilege by choosing to be in an "other" category since my focus is documentation. It happens to be highly technical, but people often overlook or even look down upon it as a contribution. Same for "oh you're a database administrator" or "oh, you are a web developer." Be very careful if you notice you take on those biases because of the industry we work in. Our industry is terrible at this categorization and stereotype creation, and it shows. We're working on making it better and this conversation is a good starting point.

Anne


In general:
Tech people engage with tech people as they know the product on a different level to non-technical people. Same goes for non-tech, the marketing guy is not going to want to talk to the kernel engineer when talking about (e.g.) the newest distro, they'll just want to know about a feature at a high level, and not how many lines of code and what algorithms were used to implement the feature.

To address the problem of people being disappointed at meeting a marketing person at a booth:
    A technical person is going to want to talk tech, and will be expecting technical person (as well as marketing) to be available to answer their technical questions. I'm not saying a marketing person wouldn't be able to answer these, but the tech person would be better qualified to discuss the highly technical stuff, as it would be their area of expertise.

So don't be offended if I want to talk tech with other technical people, and was disappointed that I didn't find as many as I was expecting in the group. Any non-technical person would feel lost in a room of engineers.

Emma

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] Meeting today

This bums me out. Maybe I?m taking this personally, but being ?disappointed" and following that with ?at least 50% of the women I met were in non-technical roles? makes it seem like women (like myself) are somehow less valuable or important because we?re not technical contributors. Perhaps that is not your intent. Nevertheless, I wanted to share some thoughts on this subject, as it?s come up quite a bit.

During a past summit, someone made a comment in a panel that they were ?offended? that someone came to the booth and thought they were ?in marketing.? A few women in the room took offense to that statement, and I understood why. It was as though marketers were somehow less important and less valuable than contributors and developers. A woman in the audience stood up, walked to the mic, and asked folks to stop saying ?they thought I was in marketing like it?s a bad thing.? She was right. That exchange made me realize that subconscious bias exists even amongst women in the same group.

As women, we should support each other!

If it weren?t for the brilliant women (and men) of OpenStack who share their expertise around public relations, social media, marketing, business development, branding, copywriting, communications, analyst relations, event planning, presentation authoring/coaching, and probably a whole lot of other stuff that I?m probably forgetting, what would OpenStack look like? There would be no summit. There would be no Women of OpenStack events. There would be no SuperUser magazine or newsletter.There would be no ?We Are OpenStack? campaign. OpenStack would NOT EXIST.

At then end of each day, we?re all human. We all have different skills, different talents, and different abilities. The cool part is that people from all around the globe are building something that is fundamentally changing humanity< something bigger than ourselves. And while the code and docs are created by technical contributors, the other side of OpenStack keeps that foundation strong and vibrant and growing. And that?s pretty cool.

Apologies if this offended anyone. That definitely was not my intent. My intent is to help us be more inclusive and embrace diversity< no matter what is printed on your badge.

Great - Let's consider this closed. We'll meet every 2 weeks, starting 11/16 (I know this will be 2 weeks in a row, but would rather do that, than start the week of Thanksgiving, when attendance may be light).

In our meeting on the 16th, the proposed agenda is:

*         Roll Call

*         Mitaka Cycle Goals

*         Action Item Follow-up

*         Opens
If you have other topics you want to propose, pls send them along!

Pls bring your thoughts and proposals for the Mitaka Cycle goals, as this will shape our actions over the next 6 months.

Thanks
Carol

*         Leading up to the Tokyo Summit, we were meeting weekly, primarily working on the details of the activities planned for Tokyo.
*         Prior to that, we generally met at Summit, with little interaction between

I am proposing that we meet every other week (potentially moving to weekly ahead of the Austin Summit, if needed). I think this strikes a balance between frequent enough for us to maintain our progress towards goals and deliverables, but not being overly burdensome on calendars.

Pls respond to this thread to either propose another option or indicate you're OK with this proposal.

Thanks
Carol
