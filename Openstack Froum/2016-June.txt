SPONSORSHIP SALES
Sponsorship sales will open Wednesday, June 15, at 8:00am PST (15:00 UTC). At that time the executable electronic contract will be made available for signature HERE <https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/sponsors/#how-to-sponsor>. All sponsorships will be sold on a first-come basis determined by the time stamp on completed electronic agreements. The top level sponsorships and limited quantity add-ons always sell out quickly so please be mindful of that. 

Full details of the sponsorship signing process are outlined here <https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/sponsors/#how-to-sponsor> and on page 4 of the Prospectus <https://www.openstack.org/assets/barcelona-summit/Barcelona-Sponsorship-Prospectus.pdf>. Once you execute the Barcelona Summit contract you will receive a confirmation email from Echosign, you must click the link in that email to complete the signing process. Don?t forget that last step! If you have any overdue balances owed to the Foundation then these must be paid in full before you sign the Summit contract.

AUSTIN SESSION FEEDBACK
During the OpenStack Summit in Austin we did not receive as many sessions ratings as we'd have liked via the mobile app. Here?s another chance to provide feedback to speakers. You'll find that the session list is based on your personal schedule. If you didn't attend one of the sessions listed, just skip it. We will also be improving the in-app feedback mechanism for future Summits. Please note that all feedback will be publicly viewable including your name. Click here <https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/review> to rate the Summit sessions that you attended in Austin.

If you have any general Summit questions, contact us at summit at openstack.org <mailto:summit at openstack.org>.

Please review today's WOO meeting etherpad and add your comments to
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_6_13_16 to join in the discussion. We
will dedicate time during each meeting to discuss our plans for Barcelona
and progress against these focus areas. Our next WOO meeting is scheduled
June 27. You can sign up to lead this meeting or another upcoming meeting
at: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_Agenda_Tracker

I have included our focus areas for the Newton cycle below including an
updated list of action item owners.

WOO Focus areas for Newton cycle
1. Create WOO mission statement with clear bullet points and definition of
scope
Ideas discussed: Lowering/removing the barriers of entry for everybody with
a targeted mission that benefits the broader group.?Ask for feedback from
the WOO mailing list and publicize the WOO mission statement (2-3
sentences)
Owner: Courtney Ferry

2. Define how WOO interacts with the OpenStack Diversity Council
Ideas discussed: Encourage WOO to engage and join in the diversity working
group discussions. The work group has decided to utilize a combination of
ML and etherpad discussion instead of regular meetings. The current agenda
and discussion is located at:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/5_19_16_Diversity_Mtg_Log
The group will conclude discussion on this etherpad on 6/3/16. They will
publish the next agenda and etherpad on 6/6/16 via the OpenStack Foundation
ML and the Women of OpenStack ML.? Follow this link to sign-up for the
Foundation mailing list to follow discussions about the diversity work
group? http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/foundation
Owner: Carol Barrett / Jessica Murillo

3. Need a resource page that is easy to navigate, and contains useful
information for new members
Ideas discussed: Mike Perez is leading work to ease on-boarding new members
to the community through online documentation. This is a year long project
to revamp how the underlying infrastructure works today and how groups can
easily add and curate their content (text, videos, etc.) We will develop a
plan for the WOO information to incorporated into the new infrastructure
foundation.
Owner: Amy Marrich and Aimee Ukasick

4. Recruit and enable more women speakers in Barcelona
Ideas discussed: Learn from a public speaking coach through a webinar or
workshop. One idea was to ask Margaret Dawson (RedHat) is a public speaking
coach to record a webinar sponsored by the WOO.
Owner: Maria Bracho

Hello, Women of OpenStack!

I could use some help.  We will be looking to hire one or two OpenStack
Operations Engineers soon, and I want to make sure that our postings are
inclusive and attractive to current and future women of OpenStack.  Does
anyone have any tips or reference job descriptions that might help me
ensure that we are attracting great female candidates?

Cheers,
James

Well, (and only if it's true),  letting the job seekers know you have 
 *  an open, collaborative environment
 *  Open door policy with regards to work, questions, issues, etc
 *  Family friendly (meaning the company/team/management works with employees to deal with all family related emergencies such as sick family members, school demands, etc)
 *  Diverse, friendly, open, supportive team
 *  looking for problem solvers

That's some of the stuff *I* look for.  But I also look for honesty, so if you don't have all those things yet, say "looking to build" that collaborative, open, diverse work environment

Hi James,

Thank you for being a change leader!

I volunteer as a Co-Chair on the Research Team at NCWIT (National Center
for Women & Information Technology). NCWIT has a lot of wonderful
resources on their website.

On the resources page (link below), you can filter by Goals:Recruiting and
Audience:-Industry/Government/Other to find tips for writing better job
ads, recruiting a diverse technical workforce, reducing unconscious bias,
and many more resources.

Hope this helps!

Thank you for asking this question. Rocky's input is very good.  Here is additional information from NCWIT.org which works on checklists and best practices for creating gender parity in technology.  This will add to what Rocky provides below.

Thanks for the question.  I think Rocky gave you some great answers. Here is additional information from NCWIT on best practices for writing a job description.

Well, (and only if it's true),  letting the job seekers know you have

*  an open, collaborative environment

*  Open door policy with regards to work, questions, issues, etc

*  Family friendly (meaning the company/team/management works with employees to deal with all family related emergencies such as sick family members, school demands, etc)

*  Diverse, friendly, open, supportive team

*  looking for problem solvers



That's some of the stuff *I* look for.  But I also look for honesty, so if you don't have all those things yet, say "looking to build" that collaborative, open, diverse work environment

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Writing better Job Descriptions



Hello, Women of OpenStack!



I could use some help.  We will be looking to hire one or two OpenStack Operations Engineers soon, and I want to make sure that our postings are inclusive and attractive to current and future women of OpenStack.  Does anyone have any tips or reference job descriptions that might help me ensure that we are attracting great female candidates?



Cheers,

James

That would be great --- using metrics to drive our WOO actions has been
brought up several times. The last time we surveyed the WOO was prior to
the Paris summit. I'd like to propose another WOO survey focused on
demographics and key focus areas.

I fully support this.  Also, it would be good to proactively partner with companies like Bitergia who did a great job of showcasing women in openstack and their contributions at the Austin summit. They would love to partner with us, but someone would need to sponsor the cost of doing the analytics work.
I will be speaking at GHC as well on diversity in open source and Amy, good to talk on how we can complement each other.

James,

Thanks for asking that question and your interest in growing a team that
includes women. You've received great feedback so far. I wanted to mention
that you probably already have access to the best way to hire women in tech
and, also important, keeping your current women employees happy. Ask your
female coworkers for a referral to a particular position and make sure you
interview every single one. Having another woman friend in the organization
is key. Women supporting women and contributing to the team is a win-win.

Best of luck!

Sorry I am not able to attend today.

One suggestion for a panel discussion-

Creating a big tent in OpenStack - What does creating a big tent in OpenStack mean and what are the benefits of having an inclusive community.  This panel will consist of people from all parts of the OpenStack community - established PTL, WOO member, Newbie and other underrepresented group.  We will discuss, why we believe in and support creation of an inclusive OpenStack and give examples of benefits.
Panel - 4-5 people mixed panel of people

Can others add to this and share more proposals on the etherpad please?  I have post this to the etherpad as well. https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_6_27_16

Folks -

Rather than being catch as catch can about the WOO sponsored 
presentations -- besides I need to get some more input for the topics.  
I have created an Ether Pad for us to share ideas.  I would like to 
identify 2 or so panel topics and people who will volunteer to be on 
them. Don't forget that presentation submissions close Mid July so we 
want to get going!

Team,

I'll add this idea to the etherpad: a session focused on the importance of diversity in innovation, using a string of TED-style talks from those across our community.  I'm working on this concept with Amy Marrich, and have reached out to some of you about participation--a big thank you for your interest!

In addition, we did some filming in Austin for a video focused on diversity--many of you participated, thank you.  Here are a few initial rough cuts--we're considering a series of short clips leading up to the next summit, and then showing the clips at the summit.  If you're interested in using them in your own activities as well, please let me know!
