Message-ID: <CAFs83Qp4yia-fDRxM7J21ty+qa25GSUK5OmJoFrcvZre8HVY4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I Boston we had an unofficial outing with some of the Upstream Institute
team along with some members of WoO and I thought I'd throw out some ideas
if folks wanted to do something in Sydney as well. And maybe by doing it
more then last minute more folks could go and it would be better
organized.:)

https://www.webjet.com.au/travel/tips/10-things-sydney-night/
https://news.experienceoz.com.au/top-10-things-to-do-in-sydney-at-night/

The second link mentions a ghost tour if we wanted to make those an
on-going tradition!

So those going to Sydney pipe in here on the list, in IRC and come join us
at the next meeting and lets get some planning going on!

Caseys seems to have good food, and they said that Wednesday they are
typically not busy. It was a little loud, but there was also outdoor
seating. Bar Louie is next door to a movie theater, which makes me
think that it could be very busy.

I agree with Amy.  There is always the Sydney Opera House.  I would love to do a ghost tour.

Reminder that we (The Women of OpenStack) are drinking together tonight if
you want to come :)

Time: 5-7pm

Casey's Pub
7301 E 29th Ave, Denver, CO 80238

You can get there via a 20ish min walk straight south or take one of the
free shuttles from the hotel.

Let's organize into two waves heading that way. People that get done with
discussions early should meet in the lobby right at 5 to head over and for
stragglers we can have a second group to head over at 5:30 (I'll be in the
stragglers group most likely).

See you all there!!! Also, please pass along the message to any other women
you run across today :)

-Kendall (diablo_rojo)

Hi,
	As you might know, we're going to be holding the Speed Mentoring
session at the Sydney summit as a regular lunch session (not sponsored).
We'd like to get the signup sheet out soon and we were thinking of doing
things a bit differently:
   Have separate signup forms for mentors and mentees
   Mentee signup form fields
      Area of interest: career, technical, community
      Email (really as a just in case contact)
   Mentors
      Ask for Name, Job Title, Area of interest, and email
      Instead of doing baseball cards, just do nametags for mentors

   This will help the event to be a little more lightweight.  Another thing
   we talked about was possibly not even having a mentee signup form and
   just taking anyone who came in.
   Thoughts or suggestions?  Thanks!
Sincerely,

Emily,

I'm on both sides of the fence on not having a mentee sign up.

pro:
You know who's coming(to some degree, you'll always have no shows and drop
ins)
You know how many of each type of mentor you'll need (this might be solved
by letting mentors being able to select multiple areas so you can shuffle
on the fly)

con:
You won't know who, if anyone is coming(or atleast planning to)
You might exceed available resources (seats or even mentors)

Thanks,

Amy

I would like unsubscribe to these emails. So, if any one of could please remove my email contact from the Women Of OpenStack member list, will really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Emily,

I'm on both sides of the fence on not having a mentee sign up.

pro:
You know who's coming(to some degree, you'll always have no shows and drop ins)
You know how many of each type of mentor you'll need (this might be solved by letting mentors being able to select multiple areas so you can shuffle on the fly)

con:
You won't know who, if anyone is coming(or atleast planning to)
You might exceed available resources (seats or even mentors)

Thanks,

Amy

Hi Emily,

1) Always glad to hear speed mentoring is happening—let me know how we can help promote this on social (date, sign ups, etc)

2) Does it cause too much trouble if you have _both_ a mentee sign up and take walk ins? I would only advertise the walk-on option the week of the Summit. You might catch someone with a gap in their schedule who suddenly feels inspired to join!

Hi Anne,
I don't think it causes trouble to have a signup and take walk-ins.  Just
that eliminating the mentee signup form might make the event a little
easier.
Thanks for the offer to promote on social.  I think after we have the
signup forms set up it would be great to have some tweets, etc.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Contributor Portal PTG Recap
Message-ID: <20170922181346.GF1592@gmail.com>

# Contributor Portal Next Steps

## Landing Page Mock ups
* Current mock up:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxMh9oiou2xMLVRvRWRFVklHa2c/view
* Limited click through mock up:
https://invis.io/CSDEZTBDJ#/252645774_Landing

## Todo
- [ ] thingee: A proposal for the *second level* of what the landing page
shows.
- [ ] thingee: Follow up with the Wes and Jimmy at the OpenStack Foundation
for design assistance.

## Communication To The Community
* [Initial
email](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2017-June/118877.html)
* [Initial full
thread](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2017-June/thread.html#118877)

## Highlights from PTG session
[OpenStack Etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/contributor-portal)

### TLDR (big changes from discussion)
* Instead of all team on-boarding documentation living in a central
repository, it will still remain with the individual teams to maintain in
their own repository. General documentation (e.g. git, creating accounts,
gerrit setup, etc) will still live in this central repo. If you choose to
contribute by code for example and you pick a project, it will take you
through our general documentation, then the project’s specific documentation.
    * This could lead to inconsistencies in documentation design? Confusion
    for the reader being sent to different pages?

### General
* We can’t go based off services. Not everything people are contributing
to is a service, so they won't have anything corresponding in the
[service type authority
repo](http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/service-types-authority/tree/service-types.yaml).
There might be a field in projects.yaml that can help with this.
    * Remind Thierry on the service type authority repo for
    grouping/mapping project.
    * Videos were considered, but they’re hard to keep up-to-date.
    Previous Documentation PTL Alexandra Settle expressed that even
    screenshots can get out of date real fast. 
    * Generate some kind of crash-course / cheatsheet content for people
    who are used to GitHub but not familiar with Gerrit. Aspiers
    volunteered for this and made this first pass [ethercalc
    sheet](https://ethercalc.openstack.org/github-gerrit).
    * Translation team needs to be included
    * Provide documentation with how to edit the landing page, since the
    source is being hosted on github (there are transition discussions in
    place with the infra team and Jimmy)
    * Help projects with creating their own contributor guides if they
    need to. Think of something like Cookie cutter for setting up the
    scaffolding for a new OpenStack project, but getting projects
    contributor guides going.

### Upstream Institute
Attendees of the session we’re more in favor of projects keeping
their specific documentation owned in their repositories. As learned
from the centralize documentation problem
[1](http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/docs-specs/specs/pike/os-manuals-migration.html)
[2](https://doughellmann.com/blog/2017/08/24/stop-working-so-hard-scaling-open-source-community-practices/)
[3](https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/top-5-help-wanted.html#documentation-owners),
this is a good move. Upstream institute would then use whatever
general documentation is provided. If people get past that, we could
even suggest on-boarding to one of the [top 5 most wanted
help](https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/top-5-help-wanted.html)!

### User Committee
Lauren Sell worked with Melvin and others from the user committee to get their
requirements and perspective on the project. Here's an ether pad:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/contributor-portal-user-section

### Mock Up Feedback
* Having the service types is great, but on the next level it would
be good to express the code name with a description of what the
project does.
* Combine in events OpenStack day, meetups, forum, ptg, etc.
(emphasize on in person thing)

### Bikeshed
* A word that combines code and documentation ("team(s)" was already
rejected)

Folks -

I agree we should take sign ups in advance, but announce at the 
conference that we are taking walk-ins.  That way people will not sign 
up and just assume that they will be able to walk in.  I would encourage 
us to do the registration greeting thing and tell them that they can 
sign-up/walk in then.
