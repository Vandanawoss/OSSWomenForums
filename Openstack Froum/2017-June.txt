Subject: [Women-of-openstack] 4 ways to get involved in OpenStack Days
	Nordic - Copenhagen 2017
Message-ID: <002c01d2ddf9$e669bc10$b33d3430$@dektech.com.au>

Good Monday from Stockholm, Sweden!

 

Tech has always been a predominantly male industry but today women are
playing a huge part too and more and more are entering both regular and
key-role positions in tech companies.

 

ILDIKO VANCSA and ALLISON RANDAL are two bright examples of the women power
in the OpenStack community and this year we are happy to have them onboard
the OpenStack Days Nordic event taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark on Oct
17-19.

Read more about Ildiko, Allison and all other keynote speakers here.
<http://openstacknordic.org/copenhagen2017/content/> 

The #OSDN Community mission is to increase awareness, utilization and
competence surrounding OpenStack.  

This year event will consists of presentations and educational opportunities
over two days, and the topics span everything from cloud strategy and
business case development to operational best practices and technical deep
dives.

Are you interested in getting involved in the event? Here are 4 ways to
consider!
<http://openstacknordic.org/4-ways-to-get-involved-in-openstack-days-nordic-
copenhagen-2017/> 

 

For more information do not hesitate to contact us at
crew at openstacknordic.org <mailto:crew at openstacknordic.org> .

 

We will be more than happy to answer your questions.

 

Welcome to the Nordics!

Hello Everyone,


My name is Sanjana.
I have some issues in configuring keystone with OpenID connect, but I am not sure if I can be discussing this issue here.
I have tried seeking help on the IRC Channel as well as ask.openstack.org but in vain. I really hope someone in this community can guide me and help me resolve my issues in configuring Keystone along with OpenID connect. If I can get in touch with someone who is familiar with this, I could share the configuration details and seek help.




Thanks and Regards,
Sanjana

Sanjana,

The best place to ask is probably the Ops list, openstack-operators@
lists.openstack.org though I do see Ops related questions on the Openstack
list as well, openstack at lists.openstack.org. Keystone channel is usually
helpful but you might have hit them when no one was on or no Ops people.

Thanks,

Amy

Mark your calendars to join us as we continue our Women of OpenStack
speaker series on June 26, 2017. We will be joined by Major Hayden,
principal architect at Rackspace, who will lead  a discussion on impostor
syndrome including how to identify it and how to overcome it.

The OpenStack community is highly collaborative, fast-paced, and helpful.
However, some new community members are overwhelmed with new terminology
and detailed processes, especially those with impostor syndrome.  They
struggle with an internal battle where their confidence and competence are
not aligned. Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon that affects
people from all backgrounds and all skill levels. They feel like their
competence level is much lower than it really is and they feel this way on
a regular basis. This can cause community members to become detached or
feel incapable of providing meaningful contributions.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] [docs][all][ptl] Contributor Portal and Better
	New Contributor On-boarding
Message-ID: <CAHcn5b3Ob=1Y07R5k_C4LnH81iV6yNe_+Lpb+rna498GAQMgKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Every month we have people asking on IRC or the dev mailing list
having interest in working on OpenStack, and sometimes they're given
different answers from people, or worse, no answer at all.

Suggestion: lets work our efforts together to create some common
documentation so that all teams in OpenStack can benefit.

First it’s important to note that we’re not just talking about code
projects here. OpenStack contributions come in many forms such as
running meet ups, identifying use cases (product working group),
documentation, testing, etc. We want to make sure those potential
contributors feel welcomed too!

What is common documentation? Things like setting up Git, the many
accounts you need to setup to contribute (gerrit, launchpad, OpenStack
foundation account). Not all teams will use some common documentation,
but the point is one or more projects will use them. Having the common
documentation worked on by various projects will better help prevent
duplicated efforts, inconsistent documentation, and hopefully just
more accurate information.

A team might use special tools to do their work. These can also be
integrated in this idea as well.

Once we have common documentation we can have something like:
    1. Choose your own adventure: I want to contribute by code
    2. What service type are you interested in? (Database, Block
storage, compute)
    3. Here’s step-by-step common documentation to setting up Git,
IRC, Mailing Lists, Accounts, etc.
    4. A service type project might choose to also include additional
documentation in that flow for special tools, etc.

Important things to note in this flow:
    * How do you want to contribute?
    * Here are **clear** names that identify the team. Not code names
like Cloud Kitty, Cinder, etc.
    * The documentation should really aim to not be daunting:
    * Someone should be able to glance at it and feel like they can
finish things in five minutes. Not be yet another tab left in their
browser that they’ll eventually forget about
    * No wall of text!
    * Use screen shots
    * Avoid covering every issue you could hit along the way.

## Examples of More Simple Documentation
I worked on some documentation for the Upstream University preparation
that has received excellent feedback meet close to these suggestions:
    * IRC [1]
    * Git [2]
    * Account Setup [3]

## 500 Feet Birds Eye view
There will be a Contributor landing page on the openstack.org website.
Existing contributors will find reference links to quickly jump to
things. New contributors will find a banner at the top of the page to
direct them to the choose your own adventure to contributing to
OpenStack, with ordered documentation flow that reuses existing
documentation when necessary. Picture also a progress bar somewhere to
show how close you are to being ready to contribute to whatever team.
Of course there are a lot of other fancy things we can come up with,
but I think getting something up as an initial pass would be better
than what we have today.

Here's an example of what the sections/chapters could look like:

- Code
        * Volumes (Cinder)
             * IRC
             * Git
             * Account Setup
             * Generating Configs
        * Compute (Nova)
             * IRC
             * Git
             * Account Setup
        * Something about hypervisors (matrix?)
-  Use Cases
* Products (Product working group)
* IRC
    * Git
* Use Case format

There are some rough mock up ideas [4]. Probably Sphinx will be fine
for this. Potentially we could use this content for conference lunch
and learns, upstream university, and the on-boarding events at the
Forum. What do you all think?

Hello all,

Wes has just took my ugly mock up of the contributor portal idea and
came up with this [1].

Here’s what he said:

"The idea is to help get potential contributors to the right place,
using the outline Mike put together. Rather than sending people to a
different page for each contribution type, users would be able to see
what options are available all on this page. We’d send them to any
necessary page(s) once they’ve gone through this quasi-wizard. Is this
along the lines of what you were thinking? page 2 shows the view once
you’ve clicked “Code” on page 1 (just in case that wasn’t super
obvious) Thanks!”

What do you all think? This does change things a bit of instead of the
landing page being more obvious of a resource of links, it’s both for
new and current contributors. Current contributors would hopefully be
able to see the resource links below.

Keep in mind that we will be working in the “Top 5 requested help” and
as suggested by Clark, an option of “I don’t know where I want to
start, but I want to help” kind of option. This would direct people to
resources such as Upstream University, mentor program, low hanging
fruit, that release priority idea I talked about earlier, etc.

Personally I like it!

First off it looks really sleek and I love the look! A few thoughts though
and I do realize it's just a mock up:

1) We have Sponsor just to pick one but don't have Operators/Administrators
and their feedback is a major contribution so please don't leave them out.
2) I would list the contributor types in alphabetical order that way no
group feels slighted, you can't help it if Use Cases are last it's just
that they start with a U vs Code which is a C.
3) What if you would like to contribute in multiple ways?

Resources are definitely still underdevelopment there but are they meant to
be broad applicable to all resources with more specialized one's visible
when you click on how you'd like to contribute?

Ah yes, I should’ve mentioned earlier that this is totally a POC.
There are lots missing, don’t worry! :)

Sure!

You would come back to the main contributor portal and click on a
different contribution. How about at the end of each lesson it gives
them the option to go back to main contributor portal to pick another
way to contribute?

That’s a good question. I think it should probably on top contain the
more general stuff, then in alphabetical order we can list resources
for all contribution types? It can be like the “I want to contribute
to OpenStack by…” top piece, but instead lists resource links to pick
through based on your contribution type(s). Maybe we keep them as
separate pages as originally given in the mock up so it’s not overly
crowded?

Thanks for the help Amy!

+ OpenStack dev list

Hello all,

Wes has just took my ugly mock up of the contributor portal idea and
came up with this [1].

Here’s what he said:

"The idea is to help get potential contributors to the right place,
using the outline Mike put together. Rather than sending people to a
different page for each contribution type, users would be able to see
what options are available all on this page. We’d send them to any
necessary page(s) once they’ve gone through this quasi-wizard. Is this
along the lines of what you were thinking? page 2 shows the view once
you’ve clicked “Code” on page 1 (just in case that wasn’t super
obvious) Thanks!”

What do you all think? This does change things a bit of instead of the
landing page being more obvious of a resource of links, it’s both for
new and current contributors. Current contributors would hopefully be
able to see the resource links below.

Keep in mind that we will be working in the “Top 5 requested help” and
as suggested by Clark, an option of “I don’t know where I want to
start, but I want to help” kind of option. This would direct people to
resources such as Upstream University, mentor program, low hanging
fruit, that release priority idea I talked about earlier, etc.

Personally I like it!
