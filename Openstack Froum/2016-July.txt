Just go an email for Chef Conf next week in Austin and one section caught my eye, dinner with a stranger. Not sure how practical doing something like this is for Barcelona but maybe in Boston?

Carol,

I'm commuting back and forth each day but I'll try to keep an ear out for chatter. I don't think it's far off from when people asked on group me but a bit more organized.:) Definitely a great way to network or just have company if you're in a new place and may not have any friends/co-workers.

I attended one of these when I attended the chef conference a few years ago in San Francisco,  then the focus was to bring the women developing chef together,  it was fun to meet and network, there was no set agenda we just introduced ourselves and just enjoyed dinner and hung out.

As always you need some outgoing people to be inclusive and get the conversations going :-).

I would love to hear how things have evolved since then.

I took a number of ideas from the Etherpad and put together a presentation on a combination of how to bring a culture of innovation and diversity to an organization.

????Folks -

Rather than being catch as catch can about the WOO sponsored presentations -- besides I need to get some more input for the topics.  
I have created an Ether Pad for us to share ideas.  I would like to identify 2 or so panel topics and people who will volunteer to be on them. Don't forget that presentation submissions close Mid July so we want to get going!

Hi,

Let me introduce myself. My name is Ifat Afek, and I'm a system architect in Nokia and the PTL of Vitrage RCA Service - a new and official OpenStack project. Oh, and I am a woman :-)

I heard that you are thinking of ways to encourage women participation in OpenStack, and I will be happy to help in this effort. I understood that you are planning several panels for Barcelona. I'd love to take part in one of them but I can't commit to that at the moment, as I already plan to submit three Vitrage sessions (which is the limit per speaker). If there is another way to help I will be happy to do it. 

Looking forward to meeting you in Barcelona,
Ifat.

Hi Beth,

I provided some feedback on the Etherpad and added one more suggestion. I'm
not sure if it's too late, but finally took some time away from snorkeling
in Hawaii for this. Hope you don't mind.

Best,

Ash

Folks -
I put in a proposal for a WOO panel based on the discussions and Nithya did as well.  If anyone else on the list wants to create a panel from the suggestions that were posted on the Etherpad discussion, I encourage you to do so.

Q: What obstacles do you think women face when getting involved in the OpenStack community?
[Barrett, Carol L] I think the challenges faced are the same for all newcomers, women are no exception.
[Barrett, Carol L] I think the challenges fall into 3 categories:

1)      Tools: Getting up and running on IRC, gerrit/github, etc. This include proxy configuration.

2)      Community Culture: How to interact with the community, how to propose a patch, how to comment on a review, etc.

3)      Building a Network: Both getting known and knowing others so that you can operate effectively within the Community.

Q: There are always a lot of debates in the OpenStack community - which one is the most important, now?
[Barrett, Carol L] I think the most important debate is the one not occurring - what is the next generation of OpenStack? Future Strategy and overall OpenStack planning.

Q. Why do you believe it is important for the OpenStack community to be diverse?
[Barrett, Carol L] People with different backgrounds think differently, see things differently and act differently. We can learn from each other and create better, more innovative solutions together!

I think getting involved in the OpenStack community is mind. the behaviors
is free. but most women are not interesting infrastructure like network,
operating system, hypervisor, hardware and etc. and in married women case,
they don't have free time for involving in the community. so I think these
issues are obstacles.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Quick poll - need your input

I am doing an interview with the superuser magazine and want to make sure to represent the sentiments and issues we see as a group.  Could you answer these 2-3 questions for me. I will aggregate and represent the answer in my Q&A.   Thank you in advance for your input and perspectives.


Q: What obstacles do you think women face when getting involved in the OpenStack community?
 I think one of the major issues is where to get started as well as how to get started. I personally haven't experienced any bias or issues working on a project but I know a lot of the people involved in the projects I've worked on.

Q: There are always a lot of debates in the OpenStack community - which one is the most important, now?
Where are we going both within projects and OpenStack as a whole.

Q. Why do you believe it is important for the OpenStack community to be diverse?
Diversity gives different viewpoints, it allows the differences in how people think and look at things to be incorporated in what we do, how we do it and why we do it.

Q: What obstacles do you think women face when getting involved in the OpenStack community?

There are strong women contributors in OpenStack and that is good news. I think the percentage is very small and there needs to be more encouragement for the rest to speak their mind, ask questions and influence decisions. I think the obstacles women face are similar anywhere in the technical world, which depend on a variety of issues:

-          Local work environment and barriers for growth

-          Access to resources

-          Individual attitudes towards challenges and risk taking.

Q: There are always a lot of debates in the OpenStack community - which one is the most important, now?

I think it should be about the rate of adoption and the future of OpenStack.

Q. Why do you believe it is important for the OpenStack community to be diverse?

Diversity is very important for an open source community as it brings varied strengths, perspectives and creativity of mind.

	Training for next OpenStack Summit
Message-ID: <CAP-MG3eHAFRvs08QdMD6fbpd==anFdUYq+qhK2zZsp-E0KQ7Lw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The OpenStack Summit is rapidly approaching and I wanted to chat about the
different mentoring efforts that are happening in the OpenStack community
before it in order to unite forces and make the best for all of them.

As the OpenStack Summit in Austin we had

- Mentoring within internships like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code
-- Duration: 3 month length
-- Target: Underrepresented groups/Students respectively interested in
contributing to OpenStack
-- Mentors: Volunteers each round, not fixed list
-- Coordinators: vkmc, mahatic, devdatta, dims
- WOO light-weight mentoring + Speed-mentoring
-- Duration: Not defined
-- Target: People getting involved with OpenStack, with no prior experience
in contributing to open source
-- Mentors: DB of mentors
-- Coordinators: ekhugen
- Upstream Training
-- Duration: 2 days training before OpenStack Summit
-- Target: People getting involved with OpenStack, with no prior experience
in contributing to open source
-- Mentors: Volunteers each edition, not fixed list
-- Coordinators: Volunteers each edition, not sure how this is defined

How can we merge all the efforts together?

Now, with regards to Upstream Training for the OpenStack Summit. Is there
any update about this training? Who is taking the lead this time? I see
that [0] shows information from latest round. Ildiko and I wanted to join
this edition too and we want to be ready to help whenever we can with it.

Best,

Victoria

Hi Victoria,
I'll send you an invite to the mentoring committee meetings on Wednesdays.
Ildiko actually contacted me yesterday to start to talk a bit about
Upstream training and the lightweight mentoring, and next Wednesday we're
set to start talking about Speed Mentoring.  We have started to talk a bit
at our meetings about how we can interact with other mentoring initiatives
in the community, like Hackathons, etc.
Thanks for bringing this up, we definitely need to get a united approach
for mentoring.
Sincerely,

Wanted to let you know that Amy Marrich & I have submitted the abstract below for a session focused on diversity.  Would really appreciate your assistance during the voting process, so that we can make sure this session is accepted.  Many thanks in advance!

Inspiring the Future of OpenStack through Diversity
https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/vote-for-speakers/presentation/15292/?category=56
The incredible spirit of open source and a community-driven development approach has spawned one of the fastest-growing open source communities in the world, with over 54,000 members across 180 countries now contributing to the OpenStack platform in some form. While there is strength in numbers, there is also strength in diversity of viewpoints and perspectives, fundamental to guiding the future of OpenStack and ensuring its vitality. Join us for a captivating session that features TED-style talks from inspiring individuals within the OpenStack community who will share their experiences and insights, and help ease the path for others to join us on our journey. Potential speakers include individuals from EMC, Comcast, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Rackspace, SanDisk, and SUSE.

All,

Could I ask you to go in and enter 'Women of OpenStack' into the speaker search button and you will find a number of sessions that a number of us submitted with the words "sponsored by Women of OpenStack. "

https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/vote-for-speakers/presentation/15292/?category=56

Would appreciate your #3 vote for these sessions - meaning you would love to see it at the show.   I have also tweeted on this @nithyaruff.  If you tweet, kindly retweet.

Hi everyone,

Just a quick plug that the biggest open source conference in Australia, linux.conf.au, has their call for proposals open for another week or so. It would be great to get some more women involved! The conference generally seeks talk proposals ranging from the deeply technical to community-focused, with the only caveat that it must be related to open source. OpenStack has been a popular topic over the past few years, with many OpenStack engineers being based in the Southern Hemisphere. This year, it's being held in beautiful Tasmania, so the sightseeing is not to be missed either!

All the info is here: http://linux.conf.au/proposals

I've been involved with LCA for many years (including being on the organising committee for 2013, and the papers committee every year since then), so if you want some personal feedback before you submit, or just want to ask questions, feel free to reach out to me directly :)

Hope to see some of you there!
Lana

Linking to a submissions doesn't work this time.
That ability was removed for this voting sessions due to community feedback.

You'll have to use the search functions to get to the abstract you want to vote for.

Thanks for all the efforts.

One outcome I'd like to see from the WOO mentoring is a duration and
end-date for the mentoring. Should it be close to the 3-months of the
Outreachy program, or 6 months, Summit-to-Summit, or for a year? By letting
mentors know when they are freed from one mentoring commitment they can
then be ready for another round.

Thanks,
Anne
