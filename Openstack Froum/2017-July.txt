Message-ID: <36F396B5-250D-40C1-B2D7-DBCCEBC8EE99@openstack.org>

Hi all,

I’m still chatting with Karen Holtzblatt about doing a talk with the group, but it won’t come together in time for our July 10th meeting. I’m happy to round up an alternative presentation since we had offered to fill this spot. 

One option is an overview of the new COA exam and some Q&A about what’s on it, how to prepare, etc. Is this of interest? If not, what other topics would you be interested in? 

Cheers,

I think this would be a great topic!

I haven't taken the COA personally, but I would definitely be interested in
hearing some tips on how to prepare for when I do get around tot taking the
exam.

Hi all,

I wanted to let all of you know about a new report (sponsored by Intel, and conducted by Bitergia) that examines gender diversity and retention within the OpenStack community. A continuation of the work that Nithya spearheaded earlier, this report studies female participation in both OpenStack leadership and governance, alongside technical projects, and provides recommendations to help increase gender diversity and inclusion across open source communities.

This is an ongoing effort, and we’re very open to evolving the research.  If you have ideas or thoughts about the study, please let me know--I'd love to hear from you!

Folks –
Here is a recording of the WOO Speaker Series: Imposter Syndrome with Major Hayden presentation




Play recording<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__verizon2.webex.com_verizon2-2Den_lsr.php-3FRCID-3De6e8985a25d7455dbdae7dafde5d5f6e&d=DwMGaQ&c=udBTRvFvXC5Dhqg7UHpJlPps3mZ3LRxpb6__0PomBTQ&r=Rsx7wkM3CoWr0KjSmfTh3iZO8Bk6HNLpvQKJmsXXw3U&m=nLy654yBsQy8ISM-6--SLuHCFnWAbzEr-1-TtdqGlpQ&s=7STJRJ-aapnOiJSCGIbl2TTp-vNc1H6Qhdsh65l2CCo&e=> (13 min 16 sec)

Major Hayden, principal architect at Rackspace, lead  a discussion on impostor syndrome including how to identify it and how to overcome it.



The OpenStack community is highly collaborative, fast-paced, and helpful.

However, some new community members are overwhelmed with new terminology and detailed processes, especially those with impostor syndrome.  They struggle with an internal battle where their confidence and competence are not aligned. Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon that affects people from all backgrounds and all skill levels. They feel like their competence level is much lower than it really is and they feel this way on a regular basis. This can cause community members to become detached or feel incapable of providing meaningful contributions.



Major's bio:

Major Hayden builds OpenStack clouds as a Principal Architect at Rackspace.

Major is a core developer in the OpenStack-Ansible project with a focus on improving information security in OpenStack deployments.  He holds multiple Red Hat and Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) certifications and has written extensively about securing virtualized Linux environments. Outside of OpenStack, Major has contributed to several open source projects including dracut, systemd, and Ansible. Within the Fedora Linux community, Major serves on the Fedora Security Team and Fedora Server Working Group. Major enjoys writing on his personal blog, major.io, and he talks about technical topics on Twitter as @majorhayden.

Thank you so much for recording this! I can't wait to listen!

On a related note, can we make all of these recording available on the WoO
Wiki page? That way its easier for people to find them and refer back if
they have missed them? Its a lot easier to just go there than to sift
through emails to find the right one for the link.

Now that I look at the wiki page [1] , its starting to get a little
cluttered and out of date, maybe we should talk about cleaning that up a
bit too?

+1 to Kendall’s note about the Wiki page. Looks like it could use a little auditing and a reorganizing, which could include adding a section for recordings. I’m down to help with that effort!

Hi Everyone,

I opened the link and it seems to be the recording for the COA exam. Do we
have one for imposter syndrome?

Hey there,

I couldn't come up with a recording mechanism fast enough when I presented
that afternoon. :/

However, there is a YouTube video of that same talk from the Boston summit
here:

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eajWhDOVjWo

I'll be happy to answer any questions or handle any feedback you have!

Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon that affects people from all backgrounds and all skill levels. They feel like their competence level is much lower than it really is and they feel this way on a regular basis. This can cause community members to become detached or feel incapable of providing meaningful contributions.

Hi everyone,

Since we still have a few days to present presentation proposals for Summit, I was wondering if anyone would like to join me on a diversity panel or BoF for women (specifically WOC) in OpenStack?

Hello Everyone :)

I did some cleanup of the wiki and in doing so I noticed that there is a
lot of outdated information in the directory and I need your help!

1. If you aren't in the directory already, please add yourself! I have
ordered it by last name so please keep to the convention :)

2. If you have switched jobs or been promoted or have a new email or
anything like that, please go update your information.

3. If you know of people that are no longer working on OpenStack or have
retired and they are still in the directory please remove them so we can
keep our information up to date.

Thank you for your help!!

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Register NOW - OpenDev,
 a New Edge Computing Event: Sept 7-8, San Francisco
Message-ID: <7CE2602D-B8D3-4C77-87D2-2625F57F9329@openstack.org>

Hello Stackers,

If you’re involved in Edge Computing then we invite you to register for OpenDev <http://www.opendevconf.com/>, a new event that's specifically focused on Edge using open technologies. 

The event is organized by the OpenStack Foundation, but it’s not OpenStack specific. Discussions will cover many relevant open technologies. OpenDev will take place at DogPatch Studios in San Francisco, September 7-8 - the week prior to the Denver PTG. 

We’d love for you to help us make it a success to drive OpenStack and other tech in the right direction for Edge computing use cases.

This two-day event is designed to facilitate collaboration at a technical level with productive, working group discussions, in addition to lightning talk presentations on Edge use cases. You can view registration, schedule and sponsorship details at http://www.opendevconf.com/ <http://www.opendevconf.com/>.  

There will be a range of sessions that are collaborative, led by moderators who dive into specific topics. Topics like managing security, what control planes need to look like, networking technologies in play, gap analysis across OpenStack and other projects, deployment considerations, zero touch provisioning and others. The discussions will be technical and specific—this is not meant to be a vision or thought leadership event, but a practical step forward in improving the state of Edge across open tech.

OpenDev will be much smaller than many of our events. The max capacity is fewer than 300 people so it will likely sell out fast. Since the event has limited size, we’re limiting registration to a max of 10 seats per company (15 seats per sponsor company). Tickets are only $100 for the two-day event. 

Register HERE <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/opendev-2017-edge-computing-tickets-35579171259> 

We’d also like to know anyone you’re working with that you think would be an important participant. If you pass their info along, we can reach out to them and get them looped in.

Thanks for helping us advance the future of Edge computing. 

Cheers,
Claire
