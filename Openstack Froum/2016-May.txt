Message-ID: <201605021446.u42EkDY2030571@d01av01.pok.ibm.com>



Hello Everyone,

  I hope you all had as good a time as I did at the Summit last week! I
especially enjoyed getting to speak at the Women of OpenStack working
breakfast on Tuesday morning. I was just wondering if anyone happened to
record the lightning talks? I didn't think to ask anyone ahead of time, and
I am kicking myself now for not doing so since it was my first Summit talk-
and my first summit for that matter. If you did or know someone that did,
please let me know!

All the Best,

Hi Kendall,

The Women of OpenStack Breakfast working sessions from the previous summits are all available on YouTube.  I have not seen the one from the Austin summit yet, but I assume it will be published sometime or maybe there is already a link that I don't know about.

Thanks,
Xing

HI All,

At previous Summits the working breakfast was hosted in one of the main conference breakout rooms that was pre-set with video record. For Austin we hosted the event in a much larger room, one of the lunch rooms, that does not host breakout sessions and therefore did not offer video record. 

Best,
Claire

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] See etherpad notes from May 2nd Women of
	OpenStack meeting
Message-ID: <201605030309.u43396xI021899@d03av05.boulder.ibm.com>



Thanks to everyone who was able to join or add comments to today's Women of
OpenStack discussion. Please take a few minutes to read and add any
additional comments in the etherpad:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_5_2_16.

There were a number of common themes in the discussion last week as well as
today:  separation of Design and OpenStack Summits and how we will continue
to reach women as the event schedule changes, on-boarding and educating new
OpenStack community members, using metrics to understand areas we should
address and formulate actions, and our interlock with the OpenStack
Diversity Council.

I will continue to summarize the input for our next meeting where we can
prioritize and assign owners to a few key actions.

Our next meeting is scheduled in 2 weeks on May 16 @ 2000 UTC.

Hi All - It was great to meet with some of you at the Summit in Austin. Honestly,  going into the Summit, I didn't think there was a lot of energy in our Community around this topic. Coming out of the Summit, the earnest and passionate discussions we had has created a renewed sense of purpose. I hope we can continue the discussion on issues, actions to address and owners to drive in upcoming team meetings.

The Doodle link below is to identify a time for the team to meet next week. Pls add your information to the Doodle by EOD Thursday (Pacific time). I will send out the winner, along with agenda and logistics.

Why not Gerrit? A large number of people in this community already use
this tool, by adding another one you're increasing the number of tools
we all have to learn. That includes infra, choosing not to use a gerrit
repo cuts us off from any help from them. It's good enough for the docs
team, why not WoO?

I suggest we not use real time meetings as the primary mechanism for moving
things forward. We've tried and failed to have rotating meeting times.

Judging by previous efforts, there is probably going to be less value in
real time discussion than there is in people taking and performing actions,
the product of which can be reviewed by the WG at their leisure.

The code of conduct is a perfect example of this. It just needs to be drafted,
reviewed for a week or two and then forwarded to the Foundation for
approval and adoption. Using Gdoc (or something else with review features.
For the love of dog, not gerrit please) rather than an etherpad would be
preferable.

Thanks to everyone who was able to join or add comments to today's Women of
OpenStack discussion. Please take a few minutes to read and add any
additional comments in the etherpad:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_5_2_16.

There were a number of common themes in the discussion last week as well as
today:  separation of Design and OpenStack Summits and how we will continue
to reach women as the event schedule changes, on-boarding and educating new
OpenStack community members, using metrics to understand areas we should
address and formulate actions, and our interlock with the OpenStack
Diversity Council.

I will continue to summarize the input for our next meeting where we can
prioritize and assign owners to a few key actions.

Our next meeting is scheduled in 2 weeks on May 16 @ 2000 UTC.

It's a poor tool for collaborative drafting. For review and approval maybe,
but we're some distance from that. Etherpad would be better than Gerrit at
this stage, but I've had plenty of success drafting stuff with the
Diversity team using gdocs.

Hi Everyone,

I think we had some very positive coverage from the media and from SuperUser TV and wanted to share 2 of those coverages.  I want to thank the foundation again - Claire and Erin for their outstanding support.  Feel free to share or tweet.

All - We held a work group meeting on 5/19/16 with 7 people attending [0], the agenda is located here [2]. The full text of the meeting can be found here [1].

Here is a summary of the discussions:
Future Meetings: The team discussed various options for on-going team working sessions and agreed to use a combination of ML and etherpad for future team collaboration. There are still some details to be worked, but the plan is to send on the ML the agenda along with an etherpad link which will be used to capture the discussion for each agenda item. At the end of the week, a summary and outcome of the discussion will be published. I think the open issue is frequency of these discussions. We agreed to evaluate how this is going in 3 Months (end of August).

Ease of On-boarding New Community Members: Mike Perez provided an update on the work underway to create a portal that the Community can populate, targeted at helping newcomers to discover info and become contributors. The portal will support all of the ways people contribute to the community, including: translations, meet up organizing, working on defining use cases for features in OpenStack, code, etc.  The idea with this that we're envisioning is a portal that gives you a "choose your own adventure" kind of feel what are you interested in contributing to? Based on your selected interests of what you want to contribute to the portal will highlight the "essential" on boarding documentation that people need to contribute.  Add'l info from Austin discussions [3] and example documentation [4]. Details are being worked, more updates as they become available.

Austin Discussion Review:  There were a couple of proposals that resonated with the people on the IRC:  The need for an OpenStack Welcoming Committee to support new comers in the Community (or people new to an area of the Community), Increase the amount of content and training delivered via Videos instead of Text, Explore co-sponsoring events/activities with the Women of OpenStack because their programs (ex. Mentoring) provide benefit to the entire community and are open to all.

You can find these notes here in the etherpad log for the meeting  here [6]. Pls review and add comments by 5/3. The agenda and timing for the next discussion will be send on 6/6.

All feedback welcome.
