Message-ID: <CAFs83Qpj4G75QF+JP1ktSwzV-9eXRqHEdGQ0=tCSi1BoToLG9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I've got a presentation all ready to go but I'm looking for panelists, or
at least 1 for submittal! As I know most Devs and Ops most likely don't
know yet if they'll be going to Boston I'm looking for a hiring manager who
might have used or might be likely to use whether the person has passed the
Certified OpenStack Administrator exam as a reason for setting up an
interview or even hired someone! If this sounds like you, or you're an Ops
or Dev who has passed the COA and know you will be in Boston and are
interested in participating let me know!

Here is the presentation write-up:

At the Austin Summit, the OpenStack Foundation officially introduced the
Certified OpenStack Administrator exam. In the almost 10 months since it's
release approximately 700 people have taken the exam. This panel would like
to present reasons why you should take the exam and what benefits the exam
could have for you. The panel will be made up of a hiring manager, an Ops
and a Dev to give attendees a more rounded view of the exam.

Thanks,

Amy

	Summit Boston
Message-ID: <7BDB8AF77E41744CAF5C8D115B01DDDB98C5CDD6@ORSMSX103.amr.corp.intel.com>

Team,

The TED-style, diversity-focused session at the Barcelona summit was well received-attendees expressed that they enjoyed hearing about the different stories & experiences of our speakers.  We're now submitting a similar session proposal for the upcoming Boston summit-please refer to the abstract below.  Provided that the session is accepted, we'll have 3 10-minute speaking spots to fill, and would love to hear from you!  If you are interested in being a speaker, or nominating others as candidates, please send me an email.  We're also very interested in expanding the breadth of our speakers to include both women & men, so if you know of any male colleagues who have served as great allies, please send me an email as well.  Many thanks in advance for your collaboration!

Session Abstract:
Guiding the Future of OpenStack through Diversity
By bringing together individuals with different backgrounds, talents, knowledge and experiences, we can create a strong foundation for innovation-and for the future of OpenStack.  Harnessing the collective expertise and energy of diverse viewpoints and perspectives is critical to the long-term success of OpenStack. In Barcelona, we heard from Holly Bazemore at Comcast, Xing Zhang at Dell-EMC, and Carol Barrett at Intel, who shared their experiences in creating a diverse pipeline of talent, mentoring others, and transforming diversity into a competitive advantage. In Boston, we will continue the conversation by hearing from others-women and men alike-who will share their unique, inspiring stories to ease the path for others to participate and contribute. Join us!

Cheers,

Hi all.

I'm looking for volunteers to speak at the next UK edition of OpenStack
Days for 2017, which will be in London on September 26th.

There'll be a formal CFP for the breakout sessions in due course, but for
now we're looking for someone who'd be comfortable addressing all attendees
for this event during one of the keynote sessions.

Drop me a mail if you're interested or if you've any questions.

Cheers.

We're happy for volunteers (or attendees) at the Speed Mentoring session,
which will be first thing in the morning on the Monday of the summit
(7:30-8:45).  I know it's early, but we do provide coffee (and breakfast,

Awesome!

There's no set topic or theme, just whatever you're enthusiastic about in
the world of OpenStack that you'd want to share with a group of like-minded
individuals.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Call for mentors and funding - Outreachy
Message-ID: <CAPfWQsq2MOx8U=5=061Tyvo+4MLOtM5Xd0znv3Zv3BYtNwhvRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

An update on the Outreachy program, including a request for volunteer
mentors and funding. For those of you who are not aware, Outreachy helps
people from underrepresented groups get involved in free and open source
software  by matching interns with established mentors in the upstream
community. For more info, please visit:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy

We so far have a confirmation for three spots for OpenStack in this round
of Outreachy. But we are receiving more applicants who are interested in
contributing to different OpenStack projects. Interested mentors - please
publish your project ideas to this page
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Internship_ideas. Here is a link that helps
you get acquainted with mentorship process:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy/Mentors

We are looking for additional sponsors to help support the increase in
OpenStack applicants. The sponsorship cost is 6,500 USD per intern, which
is used to provide them a stipend for the three-month program. You can
learn more about sponsorship here:
https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/Admin/InfoForOrgs#Action

Outreachy has been one of the most important and effective diversity
efforts we?ve invested in. It has evidently been a way to retain new
contributors, we?ve had some amazing participants become long-term
contributors to our community.

Please help spread the word. If you are interested in becoming a mentor or
sponsoring an intern, please contact me (mahati.chamarthy AT intel.com) or
Victoria (victoria AT redhat.com).

Thanks,
Mahati

Sorry for the mass reply, but I am not able to access the Vote For Speakers link. ?Attached is the screenshot of what I see; the text box there is not editable (as in, I cannot enter anything into it). ?I click on "Log in as someone else?, it logs me out, but brings me back to this same page when I try to log back in.


Best,
Swarna.
