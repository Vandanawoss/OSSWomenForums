Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Meeting Reminder - 1/9/17
Message-ID: <CAFs83QqqH3G=M_QrhvU9HjAovmdY1=5Sk8-7rSiT2-VtgAqfCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to remind everyone the next meeting will be Monday 1/9/17 at
12pm PST, 2pm CST and 3pm EST.

Dial-in info is: 1-203-277-8157 or 866-619-0383  Participant: 7217256# Leader
4018#
webex - URL:
https://verizon2.webex.com/verizon2-en/e.php?MTID=m0e7ba518a2d4487bc0a78d00055f62e2

Etherpad is at https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_01_09_17
<https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_11_28_16> and if you would like to
add something to the agenda please do so. I've thrown a few topics on that
I think wed like to at least touch base on.

I've gone ahead and fleshed out the next couple of meetings at
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_Agenda_Tracker so please sign up if
you'd like to lead a meeting. It's a great way to get some experience
leading and talking to a group in a very low key environment (we don't
bite).

Hope everyone had a good break!

Thanks,

Amy

Namrata

In the past OpenStacks, Outreachy as an organization has submitted panels and shared stories of both interns and mentors. It would be powerful to have a similar panel. My suggestion would be to work with Outreachy and see how a panel could be submitted.  They have also done it for the LinuxCon events and either Karen or Marina or others moderate it.

Thanks

Hi Namrata,

Even I would love to share my experience as a past OpenStack intern.
(December 2015 to March 2016).

I have already blogged my experience on OpenStack Superuser(
http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-openstack-and-outreachy-helped-me-write-my-first-specification/)
and it would be awesome to share it at the Summit as well.

We can be a part of the panel and share our experiences and learning and
how Outreachy has evolved over a period.

Thanks,
Akanksha

Hi,


I am khushbu. I would also love to share my experience being a mentee in
OpenStack program having Anne Gentle as my mentor. I had a great experience with her and lot of learning in various domains in OpenStack. I have shared my views in one of the Linuxcon Berlin about this program and every got inspired by it. Nithya Ruff was there, she conducted a Lunch for women's to share their views on different domains. She has already mentioned about this in a thread. So this will be great if we able to spread about this in open world. As currently, I am facing a lot of challenges to contribute in Nova and Oslo, I observed that having a great mentor in real life means a lot to make a change in society.

Thanks,


Best,

My suggestion would be to work with Outreachy and see how a panel could be submitted.  They have also done it for the LinuxCon events and either Karen or Marina or others moderate it.

Hi Namrata,

Even I would love to share my experience as a past OpenStack intern.
(December 2015 to March 2016).

I have already blogged my experience on OpenStack Superuser(
http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-openstack-and-outreachy-helped-me-write-my-first-specification/)
and it would be awesome to share it at the Summit as well.

We can be a part of the panel and share our experiences and learning and
how Outreachy has evolved over a period.

Thanks,
Akanksha

Hello,

We have several topics on the editorial calendar needing speakers for the
upcoming meetings.

Specifically for February we had planned a talk about "How to win friends
and influence people on your OpenStack project".  Please let me know if you
are interested in speaking or have a speaker in mind for this topic.  It
might be interesting to have an interactive discussion with multiple
speakers sharing their experience and providing guidance.

Also,  please consider sharing your skills and expertise on any other
topics on the calendar:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_2016-17_Editorial_Calendar

As usual,  if you have a topic to propose for the next meeting,  please add
it to the agenda on the meeting etherpad:

Message-ID: <CAPrU3jF24DyYon9=-GQ8j0Epk+H7dzBWofc7ZubQ-XHMiQz1Xw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,



You may have already heard the exciting news that the OpenStack Board of
Directors recently approved the User Committee (UC) bylaws and charter
<https://governance.openstack.org/uc/reference/charter.html>. These
remarkable changes will bring the first elected UC representatives in 2017
and expand the UC to 5 members! Voting for the 2017 UC members will be granted
to the Active User Contributors (AUC).
<https://governance.openstack.org/uc/reference/charter.html#active-user-contributors-auc>
The
current UC will continue to serve until the elections and continue with a
6-month seat. This initial election will run to determine the other two
members. Candidates ranking 1st and 2nd place will get one-year seats. In
the fall of 2017, elections will see the normal renewal of 3 seats for a
one-year period.



Open candidacy for the UC positions will be from January 30 - February 10,
05:59 UTC. Voting for the 2017 User Committee (UC) members will be
open on February
13th and will remain open until February 17, 11:59 UTC. Additional details
and the process for nomination can be found here
<https://governance.openstack.org/uc/reference/uc-election-feb2017.html>.



As a reminder, please see the community code of conduct (
http://www.openstack.org/legal/community-code-of-conduct/)



Please let me, or anyone from the UC know if you have any questions,
comments or concerns.



Thank you,



OpenStack User Committee
