Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Call For Speakers: OpenStack Summit and
 vBrownBag Tech Talks in Vancouver
Message-ID: <BAY173-W2588EF0865A3DDD27AD90C03D0@phx.gbl>

Hello Everyone,

In addition to the OpenStack Summit call for speakers, https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/call-for-speakers/ there is also a call for speakers for tech talks at vBrownBag. 



This is going to be a third summit for vBrownBag and they would like to 
have a day filled with women speakers. TechTalks are ten minute 
presentations about some aspect of technology. TechTalks are delivered 
at a major conference. They allow a focused look at a specific project, 
feature or technique. Presenters are usually the engineers or developers
 who built what they present. They have the deep knowledge without the 
marketing. All of the presentations are recorded and posted to YouTube, 
often we also live stream from the conference.



Find out more and submit a tech talk here: http://openstack.prov12n.com/vbrownbag-techtalks-in-vancouver/

Thank you,
Egle Sigler

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Pro tips for writing a killer OpenStack
	abstract!
Message-ID: <D0F67E09.85B7%nikacost@cisco.com>

Hello, wonderful Women of OpenStack!

A couple of weeks ago, myself (@nikiacosta), Diane Mueller (@pythondj), and Anne Gentle (@annegentle) hosted a webinar on How to Craft a Successful OpenStack Summit Proposal. This was a result of a blueprint session led by Jessica Murillo (@jess1camurillo) in conjunction with the Women of OpenStack.<https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Women-OpenStack-WOS-4681909?home=&gid=4681909&trk=anet_ug_hm> Our goal was to help more women submit great abstracts and get speaking slots in Vancouver.

With the deadline less than a week away on February 9th, we wanted to share the writeup from SuperUser<http://superuser.openstack.org/>, the OpenStack foundation?s website dedicated to sharing stories of OpenStack users from around the globe. Check out the write up<http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-craft-a-successful-openstack-summit-proposal> which includes links to sample abstracts, and useful information for first-time submitters and veterans alike. Or, if you have time, view the recorded presentation<http://youtu.be/CxFYNZ4jqik>.

Still need help with your idea/title/abstract? Email this list and we?ll be happy to help! We hope to see you all on stage in Vancouver!

Thank you for the encouragement, Jessica! Next week I'm going heads down for proposal writing for my own and some co-workers talks. I have a good track record and getting acceptance (so far!), so I'm happy to read and offer feedback to anyone who wants it. I'm sure there are others who feel the same way and would love to help however we can.
Cheers and have a great Thursday,
