Hi All - Yes, it's that time of the year again, that undoubtedly will cause us some issues.

I know we touched on this in Barcelona, but am not sure on the outcome.

Are we:

1)      Keeping with 2000 UTC time (which is now Noon Pacific) OR

2)      Are we sticking with the 1:00 Pacific time we've been meeting?


Not keeping UTC time will cause conflicts with other OpenStack Community meetings for me - and I'm guessing I'm not the only one.

Thoughts?
Carol

Hi All - Yes, it's that time of the year again, that undoubtedly will cause
us some issues.

I know we touched on this in Barcelona, but am not sure on the outcome.

Are we:

1)      Keeping with 2000 UTC time (which is now Noon Pacific) OR

2)      Are we sticking with the 1:00 Pacific time we've been meeting?


Not keeping UTC time will cause conflicts with other OpenStack Community
meetings for me - and I'm guessing I'm not the only one.

Thoughts?
Carol

Noon or 2000 works for me. Vote for this. Thanks Beth.

With the US time change, I now have a conflict with the WOO meetings  at
2000 UTC (3 EST/2CST/1MST/12PST). I have a standing, biweekly, internal
meeting at 3Eastern/2Central/1Mountain/NoonPacific (11/14, 11/28, 12/12,
etc), so since I haven't yet mastered being on 2 audio conferences at
once, I will miss most of the WOO meetings until US Daylight Savings
Time starts next Spring.

Please look at the etherpad notes from today's WOO discussion and add your
comments: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_11_14_16

We had a quick recap of the Barcelona WOO events and would like everyone to
have the opportunity to add their feedback on what worked well and what we
aspire to change to make the events even more successful.

In addition, I have included the results from our recent WOO demographic
survey along with the charts used during our lightening talk sessions in
Barcelona.
(See attached file: 2016_OpenStack_Barcelona_WOO_Final.pdf)

Going forward, at least one of our WOO meetings a month will have a speaker
and we'll be recording and publishing the sessions.

We also discussed upcoming events including the OpenStack Days Mountain
West (Dec 7 & 8) in Salt Lake City. The organizers are looking for
additional sponsors and there are discount codes available for attendees.

Our next meeting on November 28 will be chaired by Amy Marrich.

Hi everyone,

I have been wanting to send this email for a while but never got around
to it. I would like to attend the women of openstack meeting every now
and then but I have two problems with it:

- Time: it is 8pm UTC, which is way too late in the evening for Europe
people in general to be able to realistically attend regularly. The time
is also not very Asia friendly. Maybe some people can get up early and
attend due to this time.
- Dial-in: US centric. Is there any way to make this an IRC meeting or
if there is a call that this call also allows for people from outside
the US to log into it, maybe a google hangout or similar?

Apologies if you have already discussed this, you probably do on regular
basis. If I am the only one in this situation it is fine I will keep
reading the mailing and attending the Women of OpenStack ODS events as I
have done until now, I wonder if there are more people out there unable
to attend due to this.

Cheers,
Gema
