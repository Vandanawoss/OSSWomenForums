Emily - Thanks for the update, I also want to celebrate this significant
achievement! The WOS mentoring program is something we first dreamed about
at the Paris summit and this team has made it a reality. I know we are in
the early stages of getting the mentoring program started, but I am looking
forward to see how it develops and grows over time.

Great job and thank you Emily, Danielle, Carol, Mike, Erin, Claire, and

Hi,
I just wanted to send out a celebratory email because we've done our first

We have worked with the National Center for Women and IT Research (NCWIT) a National Science Foundation funded organization to create a workshop and a panel on   "The Diversity of Innovation".  We have leaders In the OpenStack community like Imad Sousou, Mike Muehl and  Dorian Naveh on the panel.



Call to action:  We would like to invite leaders on the board and the TC community to attend the workshop "Champions for Change" on Tuesday at lunch time and the panel the same day on "Diversity for Innovation". Both are aimed at leaders in the community to help them be champions and to role model inclusive leadership.   Details of the workshop are below.

Second your comment. This year's OpenStack will be one of the best for diversity and inclusion.   I just sent a message to the board and TC group about attending some of our workshops to model inclusion.   I can't wait for the summit.  Thank you for your leadership through the years and the contribution of this amazing group.

Hi,
I just wanted to send out a celebratory email because we've done our first set of matches for the mentoring program. We matched 33 mentors and mentees (so 66 people). Thank you so much to everyone who signed up! We still have more matches to make. We also have people signed up but waiting to make their match at our Speed Mentoring event at the Austin summit. This has been so much more successful than we ever imagined!

>> SUNDAY
>> Command Presence Workshop
>> 9:30am-12:30pm
>> JW Marriott- Salon D
>> The Command Presence Workshop has been recognized by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review. It is intended to teach participants how to handle ?senior-level high pressure meetings?. The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event. In the class, each participant assumes a role, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slides. Once the class has prepared, the simulation begins. There is a role-play simulation. It is not uncommon to hear occasional ?gasps? of disbelief from the participants. The workshop participants will experience rapid-fire questioning, interruption, and other situations that occur in senior-level meetings, but in a safe environment conducive to learning techniques for handling such situations. Facilitators: Ruchi Bhargava (Intel), Malini Bhandaru (Intel) and a panel of leaders representative of the OpenStack leadership in the community (business leaders and technical leaders).
>> RSVP Required <https://commandpresenceworkshop.eventbrite.com/>

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] [Mentoring] First batch of mentor/mentee
	matches has been made
Message-ID: <0078AE486081F642B4747581212AD05F012DB11D@IRSMSX109.ger.corp.intel.com>

This might be an appropriate time to start looking at figures for Mitaka cycle.
I believe in quantitative performance tracking, and would like to see figures to quantify improvements in participation.

While not everyone is technical, the ATC gender ratios are one metric that can be used to measure diversity in OpenStack.
The final release will be next week, but it would be interesting to see how things are trending at the moment. 
There's a script for getting these figures per release, and I made some updates to it last cycle:
https://github.com/elfiesmelfie/openstack-gender 

What are the ways of tracking/counting Openstack community involvement from an non-technical point of view?

Regards,
Emma

Hello, 
I am khushbu from India. I am going to attend openstack summit austinI have RSVP for many events. so I am thinking to develop an app (networking app)for Openstack summit that will show to all the events you have registered and talks, sessions, presentationabout speakers. It will help both the speakers and attende to be in touch even after the summitto exchange idea. Every attende detail would be their. so I want to know what other thought about it and who all are willing to collaborate in it. I have also checked previous Openstack Tokyo android app. But it is not upgraded and limited features.And I also want to know weather previous Openstack tokyo summit application is opensource?

Hi khushbu,

Sounds like a good idea. Even I would be attending the summit for the first

Hi,

I think an iOS version of app should also be there as majority of people
would be iOS users at the Summit.

I believe the Foundation folks have mentioned that they will be putting out an app closer to the summit.

That said I vote for IOS if you still want to make your own. I'm already wishing I had a clone to be everywhere I need to be:)

I?m sending this reply on behalf of my college, Jimmy, who is not subscribed to this mailing list:

Hi All -

Wanted to quickly respond re: Summit mobile apps. OpenStack Foundation is currently in the process of launching native iOS and Android apps. They're in the queue at both respective app stores and should be rolled out within a week. Features include:

* My Calendar option - allows you to add one or more events to your calendar to set your summit schedule
* Caching - App works completely offline after installation, with the exception of features that require a login (Feedback and My Calendar)
* RSVP buttons to events
* Advanced Search/Filter options - search by Track, by Date, by Tag
* Ability to leave feedback for Summit Presentations and Events
* List of all Design and Main Summit events, along with offsite evening events (Community Party, etc...)
* Uses OpenStackID 
* Allows users to associate their EventBrite registration with their OpenStackID

These apps are opensource, though will remain private until just after Austin. This is just the first rev and we have many, many more features planned for Barcelona, including friending users, sharing schedules with other users, and creating custom team schedules for you and your friends.

Looking forward to everyones feedback after Austin. 

Thank you!
Jimmy McArthur
OpenStack Foundation

There was a group (8 or so) that joined based on the invitation that was on
our calendars 3PM ET, 2PM CT, 12noon PT. When I convert UTC to CT that I
had the correct time on my calendar, but it appears the meeting times are
not completely synchronized after the time change in April.

Yeah I was just talking to Mike(thin gee) over on irc. We need to either change the meeting time on the wiki or update the meeting invite. This is the second meeting we've actually ended up having 2.

We had an email thread on how to address the time change. It seemed that the group wanted to keep the Noon Pacific meeting time and not shift with Daylight Savings. This means that the meeting will occur at 1900 UTC. I have updated the wiki page to reflect this.

Sorry for the confusion

Rhonda,

Go for it, if we can't answer we can probably point you in the right direction.

Hello -

I am a new member of this list.  I would like to post a technical question and get the opinion of this community, but I also want to respect the intention of the topics on this list.

Can someone let me know if a technical inquiry would be welcomed?

Thank you, Amy!  Here goes:

We have a Contrail Cloud Platform Configuration.   We are considering a single node reference that is then extended to additional nodes based on the growth.   It is unknown if compute, storage, or networking requirements will grow first.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

I appreciate the encouragement.

Rhonda,

Well main disadvantage would be single point of failure, we do something very similar with the OpenStack-Ansible project's AIO installs but those are generally fro PoC and development. My guess from experience is compute and network will grow before storage but it depends on your use case.

I think you'd get the best response probably over in the #openstack channel on freenode, lots of folks over there to answer questions.

Rhonda,

I suspect the best places to ask this question (besides Amy's suggestion of the IRC channel) would be the openstack-operators mailing list *and* the openstack mailing list.  This would hit two groups who implement and/or are experimenting with OpenStack clouds and you won't get anyone telling you your question is "inappropriate" and belongs on one of the two lists I've mentioned ;-)

I totally agree with Amy.

It very much depends on how chunky your single node is compared to the 
amount of resources your VMs are going to require. Decide what kind of 
flavors you are going to use (i.e. how much memory, CPU and HD you will 
need per VM) and then do the math to see how many of those you can fit 
on your node. It all depends very much on your workload. If you are 
going to have many small VMs, you'll be able to get more out of your HW 
than if you have one big VM eating all the resources.

Also, simple maintenance tasks like upgrading packages/kernel will cause 
a disruption to your service.

I wouldn't go to production with less than 3 nodes for a small and cozy 
cloud.

Cheers,
Gema

Great advice, Gema and Amy.

Three node is definitely the smallest size anyone should consider for a working setup as opposed to test/R&D.  I've been trying to get "reference architecture" for a three node and a five node HA cloud, as this is tribal knowledge within the Ops community, but getting it defined and documented has not really gone anywhere.  Maybe we can get this going through a collaboration with this group, Ops and somd specific Docs folks.

Rhonda,

When I looked at fuel for an icehouse deployment at a former company the
concern was that is was proprietary but that is no longer the case.
There?s at least 4 options available that I can think of offhand within
the OpenStack projects OSA (ansible), puppet, kolla and fuel and that?s
not even taking into consideration projects such as heat which can be tied
into a chef server.

Between the IRC channels and mailing lists you?ll get a lot of
information, suggestions as well as opinions.:)

Look forward to meeting you in Austin!

Amy

Hello ladies and looking forward to meeting everyone in a few weeks!

Redapt has deployed several RA variations of OpenStack. We have worked pretty closely with Mirantis on multiple projects. I can send over details of an RA later this afternoon.

Great advice, Gema and Amy.

Three node is definitely the smallest size anyone should consider for a working setup as opposed to test/R&D.  I've been trying to get "reference architecture" for a three node and a five node HA cloud, as this is tribal knowledge within the Ops community, but getting it defined and documented has not really gone anywhere.  Maybe we can get this going through a collaboration with this group, Ops and somd specific Docs folks.

I totally agree with Amy.

It very much depends on how chunky your single node is compared to the amount of resources your VMs are going to require. Decide what kind of flavors you are going to use (i.e. how much memory, CPU and HD you will need per VM) and then do the math to see how many of those you can fit on your node. It all depends very much on your workload. If you are going to have many small VMs, you'll be able to get more out of your HW than if you have one big VM eating all the resources.

Also, simple maintenance tasks like upgrading packages/kernel will cause a disruption to your service.

I wouldn't go to production with less than 3 nodes for a small and cozy cloud.

Cheers,
Gema

Haven't used this one.

Another way to quickly model your cloud and deploy is using juju:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/78314/how-do-i-deploy-an-openstack-cloud-with-juju

If you want to use this approach, I can help :)

Cheers,
Gema

I've been trying to get "reference architecture" for a three node and a five node HA cloud, as this is tribal knowledge within the Ops community, but getting it defined and documented has not really gone anywhere.  Maybe we can get this going through a collaboration with this group, Ops and somd specific Docs folks.

Decide what kind of flavors you are going to use (i.e. how much memory, CPU and HD you will need per VM) and then do the math to see how many of those you can fit on your node. It all depends very much on your workload. If you are going to have many small VMs, you'll be able to get more out of your HW than if you have one big VM eating all the resources.

Rhonda,

Here is an example Mirantis/RA that has been vetted and deployed. Redapt is agnostic solutions team and we have deployed multiple customized solutions depending on preferences and needs. We can certainly chat further in Austin or before.

Looking forward to meeting more of the ladies at OpenStack!

Hello ladies and looking forward to meeting everyone in a few weeks!

Redapt has deployed several RA variations of OpenStack. We have worked pretty closely with Mirantis on multiple projects. I can send over details of an RA later this afternoon.

Great advice, Gema and Amy.

Three node is definitely the smallest size anyone should consider for a working setup as opposed to test/R&D.  I've been trying to get "reference architecture" for a three node and a five node HA cloud, as this is tribal knowledge within the Ops community, but getting it defined and documented has not really gone anywhere.  Maybe we can get this going through a collaboration with this group, Ops and somd specific Docs folks.

I totally agree with Amy.

It very much depends on how chunky your single node is compared to the amount of resources your VMs are going to require. Decide what kind of flavors you are going to use (i.e. how much memory, CPU and HD you will need per VM) and then do the math to see how many of those you can fit on your node. It all depends very much on your workload. If you are going to have many small VMs, you'll be able to get more out of your HW than if you have one big VM eating all the resources.

Also, simple maintenance tasks like upgrading packages/kernel will cause a disruption to your service.

I wouldn't go to production with less than 3 nodes for a small and cozy cloud.

Cheers,
Gema

 @ OpenStack Summit in Austin / WOS stickers available
Message-ID: <201604070547.u375lHod013565@d01av02.pok.ibm.com>



If you will be coming to Austin for OpenStack Summit one of the highlights
will be the Women of OpenStack working session (breakfast and coffee
provided) on Tuesday morning (7am-8:45am). I'd like to thank Comcast for
sponsoring the session and invite each of you to join us to hear from other
women in the OpenStack community and discuss how we can support each other.

During the session we'll celebrate our accomplishments over the past year
and hear lightning talks from three Women of OpenStack who have recently
taken on new roles within the OpenStack community. The speakers and will
share their insights on how you can accelerate your learning curve to
navigate and become an influencer within the OpenStack community.
      Kendall Nelson, OpenStack Developer
      Lana Brindley, Project Technical Lead
      Allison Randal, OpenStack Board Member


We'll break into small groups to discuss the key lightening talk messages
and identify actions for the Women of OpenStack to achieve over the next
six months.?I am looking for volunteers to help facilitate the small group
discussions by recording the key themes from your break out group. If you
would like to volunteer to be a group facilitator, please send an email to
jessicak at us.ibm.com.


Session logistics:
Tuesday, April 26, 7:00am-8:45am
Location: Austin Convention Center - Level 1 - Expo Hall 5
RSVP:
https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/summit-schedule/events/7372

On a related topic, a question came up this week in our Women of OpenStack
planning meeting re: a Women of OpenStack logo to help identify supporters
of our group. Great news -- we WILL have Women of OpenStack artwork
stickers available at all of the women-specific events starting on Sunday.
You can pick the stickers up, share them with your friends, and show your
support for the Women of OpenStack by adding them to your summit name
badge, laptops, etc.

17 more days ... can't wait to see you all in my hometown of ATX!

Hello Ladies!

I will be presenting at the summit  along with Cindy Pallares on the
Internship programs the OpenStack participates in mainly Outreachy and
GSoC. I wanted to know if we have some kind of statistics recorded for the
years that OpenStack has been participating in these programs.  And
statistics in terms of number of participants and success rates and stuff
like that.

For a starting point (and you may already have these), you can get
Outreachy and GSOC internship summaries from the openstack.org/blog and
from the superuser.openstack.org site. That should give you nice stories to
incorporate in your presentation also.

This is what I?m able to pull right now. The Travel Support Program (TSP) dates back to the Hong Kong Summit in 2013, but the records are buried at the moment. You can find some reporting at the bottom of the wiki: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Travel_Support_Program

TSP Summit Awardees:
Paris - 13 male, 7 female 
Atlanta - 20 male, 2 female
Vancouver - 21 male, 7 female
Tokyo - 12 male, 18 female

It is intended to teach participants how to handle ?senior-level high pressure meetings?. The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event. In the class, each participant assumes a role, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slides. Once the class has prepared, the simulation begins. There is a role-play simulation. It is not uncommon to hear occasional ?gasps? of disbelief from the participants. The workshop participants will experience rapid-fire questioning, interruption, and other situations that occur in senior-level meetings, but in a safe environment conducive to learning techniques for handling such situations. Facilitators: Ruchi Bhargava (Intel), Malini Bhandaru (Intel) and a panel of leaders representative of the OpenStack leadership in the community (business leaders and technical leaders).

At the meeting today, it seemed like no one called in at 1900 (I didn't
call in until 1910, so maybe I missed some people).  Several people called
in at 2000 and no one voted there to move it back to 1900.  So we're at
2000 UTC (1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern) for our next meeting which will be May
16.  Thanks!

Hi all,

Just a heads-up that we?re experiencing a rainy month here in Austin. Before you pack up to travel please check the weather forecast and bring your umbrellas and rain jackets. 

We?ll be supplementing umbrellas for a percentage of attendees, but we won?t have enough to give to everyone. So plan ahead and bring your own rain gear to play it safe. 

Rain or shine it?s going to be a great Summit!  Just pack for the weather to stay dry. :)

Thanks,
Claire

	mentoring program
Message-ID: <CAPfWQsqd1q2md-d_JXt1yjzHkCKe2DnirPq+0uReTarb9pza0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Me, Victoria and Rossella are doing a talk on Mentoring at the Austin
summit. We'd like to spread the word about WOS lightweight mentoring
program as well through the talk. If someone could address the queries
below, it'll be great.

I'm aware there was a call for mentors (via a questionnaire format) and
that we now have mentors signed up for the program. There is also going to
be speed mentoring at the summit where mentees get to interact with
mentors. My query is:

1) Was there also a sign up for mentees? Or are mentees going to
participate in the mentoring program at the summit, fill out a survey and
post that there will be pairing up with mentors?

2) Is the survey at mentoring program going to be for both mentors and
mentees?

Thanks your time!
Mahati

I said on Group me I would resend this out.

One thing not on here is ghost tours<http://www.austinghosttours.com/> which I always find to be a great way to learn interesting historical stuff about a place, I have not been on any in Austin. There is one on Saturday night that leaves from outside Moonshine<http://moonshinegrill.com/> which is southern comfort food and quite good.

Most of the restaurants downtown are really good so it'll depend on what you feel like eating:)

Gruene - Historic District in New Braunfels, home of the oldest Dance Hall

San Antonio Riverwalk

New Braunfers Crawfish Festival - 4/29-30


BBQ:

Lockhart is the heart of TX BBQ - 4 historic places, I recommend Black's

The Salt Lick - historic cash only in Driftwood, plan on a 2+ hour wait on a weekend. I like Black's better:)


Things to do:

Tours of Hill Country Wineries

Lady Bird Lake - uberable

Botanical Garden in Austin - uberable

State House - walkable

Natural Bridge Caverns - New Braunfels need car

Hi Mahati,
1.  We didn't do a separate call for mentees.  Between the Upstream
University and the Speed Mentoring session, as well as some others hearing
about the program, we had quite a few mentees signed up.  After the summit
we will continue to match people, so if mentees don't find a mentor at the
Speed Mentoring session or upstream, we'll still work to make sure they
have a mentor.
2. The questionnaire is the same for mentors and mentees.

Our goal is to match all the mentees in the program, but right now we have
137 total people signed up and we've matched about half of them.  So we
have a lot of work ahead of us, certainly we're seeing even without
advertising that mentees are signing up much faster than mentors, so that's
why in our public calls we focus on asking for mentors.

Thanks for spreading the word about the mentoring program!  We're always
happy for new signups.
Sincerely,
Emily Kate Hugenbruch

Hi All  - Great sessions here at the Summit! Looking forward to catching up with the folks who didn't make it to Austin in our next team meeting.

Speaking if which, our next meeting is scheduled for May 2nd. I want to check with you all and see if we want to keep that date or if time is needed to dig-out of the build-up of emails and meetings awaiting your return from Austin?

Pls reply to this email and indicate whether you want to meet on 5/2/16 or pickup on 5/16/16.

Thanks
Carol

A big thank you to IBM, Intel and EMC for sponsoring it.

Here are the pictures from the photo booth. They will only be available online for the next two weeks.

Hi,

Newbie here, attending my first openstack summit here at Austin!

I think our handle #openstack-women should be listed in the openstack IRC
wiki here - https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC

Thanks,
Abby

Hi Abby,
I think that's a great idea.  You don't need anyone's permission to update
a wiki page, so I would say you should go ahead and add it.  Good catch!
Thanks!

 thanks all!

We had 13 small group discussions with a total of 118 people who joined us
yesterday morning for our Women of OpenStack working breakfast in Austin!
It was an early morning, but it was well worth it to hear from three Women
of OpenStack who have recently taken on new roles within the OpenStack
community. All our speakers shared unique points of view on how they
approached their transition that contained useful tips we can use today and
stimulated the group discussion afterwards.

None of this could have been possible without our event sponsor Comcast,
and our three Women of OpenStack lightening talk speakers:
      Kendall Nelson, OpenStack Developer
      Lana Brindley, Project Technical Lead
      Allison Randal, OpenStack Board Member

Thanks to our facilitator volunteers, the discussion notes and key focus
areas for Barcelona were recorded on etherpads that we will summarize and
post on the WOS wiki soon. The results will also be discussed at our next
Women of OpenStack Monday meeting.
