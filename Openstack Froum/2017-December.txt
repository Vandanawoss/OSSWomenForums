Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Agenda Tracker Proposal
Message-ID: <CAJ6yrQi7z-BTRL=Xma1yK9VSF8apYG5gkqo+n0Ah=2zLFhGkmQ@mail.gmail.com>

I had a thought and was curious to know what you all think :)

Background: Most projects keep track of weekly agendas on a single etherpad
to persist history in one place OR they use their wiki so that its easier
to see what is coming for the next week's meeting.

Personally, I think a new etherpad every meeting is a little much
especially when I can never remember the date of the next meeting (maybe
this is just me), but I know its kind of how things have been done.

My proposal to just transform the agenda tracker[1] into the actual list of
agendas rather than a list of etherpads with the agendas. I think it would
be nice cause we can all book mark it so that we go back to the same one
every week and it will be easier to promote at events given that it won't
change. Its also less work for the leader because they won't need to create
and publicize the new agenda each meeting.

Thoughts?

Other projects already do it this way. Essentially, the latest agenda gets put at the top of the etherpad, then discussions/notes/attendance get filled in below the agend and above the previous agenda.  I think it works fairly well.  And like you said, bookmarkable!

Hi guys,

My name is Angeh Courage, computer engineering student at the University of

Initiavie for 2016/2017 and I am good with Python, Java - Spring, web(HTML,
CSS, JS - React, Angular...)
I am very interested in cloud computing and containerization and also
interested contributing to openstack and I will like some help on where I
should get started.

Thanks,
Angeh

Hello Again :)

I know I had responded the other day, but I just wanted to check in and
make sure the setup was going well. We would love to chat with you on IRC
in #openstack-dev or in #openstack-women. Feel free to ping me once you get
connected and we can chat more about getting you connected with a project.

Here are those directions again if you need them[1].

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Agenda Tracker Proposal

Hello,

Following up on this thread now that its died down and I was reminded of it
today by someone in the #openstack-women channel asking where the agenda
was.

Seems like there hasn't been any negative feedback on this proposal so I
will start using the Agenda Tracker etherpad[1] for the next meeting's
agenda instead of creating a new one.

Thanks!
-Kendall (diablo_rojo)
