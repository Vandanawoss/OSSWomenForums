Hi All,

We have four potential days to run mini virtual sprints according to the current state of the poll, which are:

* Sept. 6 / Tuesday
* Sept. 12-13 / Monday-Tuesday
* Sept. 16. / Friday

The poll is still open if anyone would like to join us: http://doodle.com/poll/geaq6fdsg749nsnc <http://doodle.com/poll/geaq6fdsg749nsnc>

I think if we choose a content block and goals wisely we can have great progress in these intervals, I will add proposals to the etherpad (https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/upstream-university-improvements).

@Ian, Matjaz: I?ve lost track a little bit on the Training Guides meetings. It would be great if we could use the slot on Monday for planning regardless we have an actual meeting scheduled or not. Do you think it would be possible?

I was also thinking to run the meetings weekly in September and first half of October or maybe even until the Summit to check progress and ensure we are coordinated. What do you think?

Thanks and Best Regards,
Ildik?

As we are not in the same time zone, I don?t think it?s an issue. The point here is to have time periods when we are focusing on this activity by adding and reviewing content. Regarding communication, does the training guides team has an IRC channel? Or should we use #upstream-university for these sprints?

I will also generate a Google Hangout link we can use if we have more people available at the same time and there?s a topic that needs brainstorming as I think a call sometimes more effective than the text based chat. We can use IRC for clarifying smaller things and giving heads up to the team for new reviews for instance or leaving notes to others in other time zones. :) Does it sound ok?

Great, I added this item to the etherpad.

I saw in the meeting schedule that it is still listed as weekly meeting, so I hoped that it will not be an issue from administration perspective. :) I think before the Summit we will need a weekly sync to ensure we finish with our plans and prepped for the next training properly.

Have a nice weekend, talk to you on Monday!

Thanks,

We use #openstack-doc channel for general communication including 
several specialty teams, and if we are focusing on something, IMO
opening a virtual sprint and discussing on #openstack-sprint channel 
would be nice.

For #upstream-university, although AFAIK it is designed for the 
communication with upstream university students (e.g., mentoring),
we can use, but one (minor) problem I think is that the channel bot 
(upunbot) seems to be dead.

Hi,

I added the most popular slots from our poll to the Virtual sprints wiki: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VirtualSprints#Upstream_training_Sprint

I added there the #openstack-sprint IRC channel and also a Google Hangouts link to ensure we have all the possibilities to chat.

There are a few etherpads for the different modules already in the main one that we can use during the sprint slots. We can also add there open reviews for the different blocks, that might makes it easier to coordinate our efforts.

Please let me know if you ave any questions or comments.

See you on the meeting tomorrow at 1700UTC on #openstack-meeting!

Best Regards,
Ildik?

Hi,

On the today?s meeting we decided to go with two large modules for the virtual sprint days:

* Common items: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/upstream-uni-common-items (coordinated by Ildiko Vancsa, ildikov)
* Code contribution: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/upstream-uni-code-contribution (coordinated by Kendall Nelson, diablo_rojo)

We can add more items later if we finished before the end of the sprint.

We did not specify any specific time slots yet for the days so on Tuesday (Sept 6) everyone will work in their own time zone and we will collaborate on #openstack-sprint or the Google Hangouts meeting added to the wiki in the overlapping hours. We can pick specific slots for the upcoming days if needed.

Those who signed up for the sprint will work on either of the above main items. The common items module covers several areas that already has slides prepared. The preference is to update the already existing material rather than creating new ones. First we would like to have the updated material up and then decide about the final structure of the training. And as usual, more hands are needed, please join us if you would like to help out! :)

If you have any questions or comments please reply to this thread or jump on IRC tomorrow or any of the sprint dates and participate in the sprint. :)

Thanks and Best Regards,
Ildik?

If anyone is attending the Grace Hopper Conference in Houston the week before summit and would like to help out as a mentor during the OpenStack hack-a-thon on Friday during Open Source Day please let me know. We will be doing an intro to OpenStack using Heat to deploy a Wordpress instance the participants will be able to customize.

Hi team,



In Austin, a sub-group was formed to help define a process for AUC (Active
User Contributor) recognition.  This working group was created to assist
the User Committee
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/UserCommittee> (UC)
define its constituency in a manner similar to how the Technical Committee
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/TechnicalCommittee> (TC)
has defined the designation of Active Technical Contributors
<http://governance.openstack.org/reference/charter.html#voters-for-tc-seats-atc>
 (ATC)/Active Project Contributors
<http://governance.openstack.org/reference/charter.html#voters-for-ptl-seats-apc>
(APC)
and participants eligible to participate in the electoral process for Project
Team Leads
<http://governance.openstack.org/reference/charter.html#project-team-leads>
(PTL)
and Technical Committee members. The User Committee formally started
conversations to recognize contributions inside the OpenStack community
that are out of scope for the ATC designation. The scope for this new
designation is currently being refined but the intent is to recognize
OpenStack community contributors (such as operators) that are not
committing code to an OpenStack TC sanctioned project
<https://governance.openstack.org/reference/projects/>. OpenStack community
contributions such as code contributions to repositories under User
Committee governance (e.g. OSOps <https://github.com/osops>, ops-tags
<https://github.com/openstack/ops-tags-team>, etc.), active participation
in any User Committee working group (e.g. API-WG
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/API_Working_Group>, Enterprise-WG
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Enterprise_Working_Group>, Product-WG
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ProductTeam>, etc.), moderating sessions
at OpenStack Ops-meetups
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Operations/Meetups>, organizing OpenStack user
group meet-ups <https://groups.openstack.org/> across the world, and many
other forms of contributions are currently being considered for inclusion
in the formal definition of the User Committee constituency



During the Mid-Cycle Operators meeting in NYC, we discussed adding the
Women of OpenStack to the list of recognized groups.  To recognize
individuals for AUC status, we would need to track active participation
after each meeting, we are currently developing a form for that purpose.



I would like to know what the team thinks about this endeavor, and if they
are interested in AUC recognition.



Thank you.

Megan ?great idea.  People are always surprised by how active WOO is and how they have made a big impact on each summit and in between through dev onboarding, support systems, education and really increasing the participation of women to 12% of summit attendance.  We have made It a mainstream topic and there are amazing contributions from WOO.    There is also formal tracking of minutes and attendance so it would lend itself to it.

Hi team,

In Austin, a sub-group was formed to help define a process for AUC (Active User Contributor) recognition.  This working group was created to assist the User Committee<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/UserCommittee> (UC) define its constituency in a manner similar to how the Technical Committee<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/TechnicalCommittee> (TC) has defined the designation of Active Technical Contributors<http://governance.openstack.org/reference/charter.html#voters-for-tc-seats-atc> (ATC)/Active Project Contributors<http://governance.openstack.org/reference/charter.html#voters-for-ptl-seats-apc> (APC) and participants eligible to participate in the electoral process for Project Team Leads<http://governance.openstack.org/reference/charter.html#project-team-leads> (PTL) and Technical Committee members. The User Committee formally started conversations to recognize contributions inside the OpenStack community that are out of scope for the ATC designation. The scope for this new designation is currently being refined but the intent is to recognize OpenStack community contributors (such as operators) that are not committing code to an OpenStack TC sanctioned project<https://governance.openstack.org/reference/projects/>. OpenStack community contributions such as code contributions to repositories under User Committee governance (e.g. OSOps<https://github.com/osops>, ops-tags<https://github.com/openstack/ops-tags-team>, etc.), active participation in any User Committee working group (e.g. API-WG<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/API_Working_Group>, Enterprise-WG<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Enterprise_Working_Group>, Product-WG<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ProductTeam>, etc.), moderating sessions at OpenStack Ops-meetups<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Operations/Meetups>, organizing OpenStack user group meet-ups<https://groups.openstack.org/> across the world, and many other forms of contributions are currently being considered for inclusion in the formal definition of the User Committee constituency

During the Mid-Cycle Operators meeting in NYC, we discussed adding the Women of OpenStack to the list of recognized groups.  To recognize individuals for AUC status, we would need to track active participation after each meeting, we are currently developing a form for that purpose.

I would like to know what the team thinks about this endeavor, and if they are interested in AUC recognition.

Thank you.

Hi All,

We have four potential days to run mini virtual sprints according to the current state of the poll, which are:

* Sept. 6 / Tuesday
* Sept. 12-13 / Monday-Tuesday
* Sept. 16. / Friday

The poll is still open if anyone would like to join us: http://doodle.com/poll/geaq6fdsg749nsnc

I won?t be available for the whole day, but I will join as much as I can. I?ll look at the review queue regularly, though.

I think if we choose a content block and goals wisely we can have great progress in these intervals, I will add proposals to the etherpad (https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/upstream-university-improvements).

@Ian, Matjaz: I?ve lost track a little bit on the Training Guides meetings. It would be great if we could use the slot on Monday for planning regardless we have an actual meeting scheduled or not. Do you think it would be possible?

Yes, absolutely. You can even add specific topics to the official meeting agenda at https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/training-guides-meeting-agenda

I was also thinking to run the meetings weekly in September and first half of October or maybe even until the Summit to check progress and ensure we are coordinated. What do you think?

We switched to biweekly schedule because the attendance at the meetings was low and we wanted to see if biweekly schedule is enough. Fortunately, we still have a reservation for weekly meetings so I see no problems with this.

What do others think? We switch bask to weekly meetings until the Summit?

Cheers,
Matjaz



Thanks and Best Regards,
Ildik?

Hi Ian,

Thanks for sharing your availability.

I created a Doodle poll with dates: http://doodle.com/poll/geaq6fdsg749nsnc  Anyone who?s interested, please add your availability if you?re interested to participate.

I think we can aim for multiple shorter periods rather than one long one as we have multiple areas to improve. I would like to have well defined areas  like:

* Updating the common content
* Work on the exercises for the code contribution block
* Work on content and exercises for the Documentation contribution block
* Finalise and test the Dev env.
* Etc.

If possible it would be great to have drivers for each of these blocks. We can then decide based on people?s availability to what to work on in a more focused way and when and we also need to define goals to see what progress we made.

What do you think?

Thanks,
Ildik?

Hello Ildiko,

Great!

But unfortunately, due to my personal schedule, approximately, Sep 7 12:00 UTC - 9 12:00 UTC will not be available for me.

Would it be okay to have a sprint on around Sep 10-15?


With many thanks,

Hi Ian,

Thanks for the link for the sprint.

I think we can make it 100% official and post on the wiki page as well. The idea is to have dedicated time, when we focus on content, exercises, environment, etc. We need to decide the scope and define goals for the sprint and work on to achieve those.

After talking to a few people mid- or second half of next week seems like a good target, e.g. Sept 6-8 or 7-9. I think that gives us enough time to figure out the sprint goals and it?s still in time from the Summit/training perspective, so we can either have another round of this if needed or work more offline on remaining items.

What do you think?

Best Regards,
Ildik?

Hello,

@Mark,

For a newcomer, a desktop screen with basic explanation on the environment
(e.g., default user ID, default password, "/opt/stack" directory + upstream training logo if it is okay)
like http://www.flickr.com/photos/31838982 at N08/7798881316/ (I searched on Google) would be nice I think.

For network connectivity on OpenStack instances, I usually used the following command. I am sure it will work well
: $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

@Ildiko,

IMO testing virtual machine environment is also a good topic for our sprint, so I updated on Etherpad.
And will our sprint be a kind virtual sprint, like https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VirtualSprints ?


With many thanks,

/Ian

Thanks Ian for the constructive critique!
Before addressing the issues, I want to ask the others too, if you try out the image, please think of what *you* as a newcomer would be happy to start with (firefox bookmarks, editor settings, missing tools which are not installed, etc.) Especially if there's windows/osx people here, I'd be happy to hear what would you miss from the VM what you use on the host machine. Thanks guys!

- I would recommend to enable "Reinitialize the MAC address of all
network cards" option when importing the virtual appliance using VirtualBox.
OK, TBD
- There is a warning: "The shared folder 'vagrant' could not be set up:
Shared folder path
'/home/oro/projects/_github.com/kmARC/openstack-training-virtual-environment'<http://github.com/kmARC/openstack-training-virtual-environment'>
is not absolute."
Yeah, I realized this, will remove

- It seems that DevStack source is already stored in the OVA file. We
might need to guide users to execute 'git pull' to retrieve the latest
DevStack source.
I'll build the image one or two days before the actual course, so it won't be a problem.

- No port forwarding and additional host-only network interface prevent
users from accessing Horizon on users' host OS environment.
 (e.g., the connection from Internet Explorer (out of VirtualBox) to
Horizon (executing in the virtual machine) is not supported.)
On the network side I'll do some more improvements. Now it's not even possible to start a VM and get networking in it, IIRC

- If we might use old OVA images during upstream training (as fresh as
possible would be nice but freshest DevStack environment would be so
ideal), then making DevStack offline (using 'OFFLINE=True' option in
local.conf) would be also nice to less use network bandwidth.
Oh, I didn't know about this. We will definitely use it then, thanks!
I try to fix these over the weekend, stay tuned for the next "release" :-)
Mark

Hi,

We had our first sprint day to improve the Upstream training material and we have still three to go.

We started to work on both the 'Common items' and 'Code contribution' parts and besides this we started to improve the infrastructure as well like switching to another IRC channel with the training and having a sandbox Launchpad project.

The list of open reviews is the following:

* Remove rejoin-stack.sh from the Devstack slides: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/366316/
* Improvements to the contribution process section: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/366255/
* New introduction block: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/366893/

* Add #openstack-101 to meetbot channels: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/367005/


The upcoming sprint days are:

* Sept 12-13/Monday-Tuesday
* Sept 16/Friday

The sprint details can be found on the following wiki: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VirtualSprints#Upstream_training_Sprint

The main blocks in focus for the sprint days:

* Common items: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/upstream-uni-common-items (coordinated by Ildiko Vancsa, ildikov)
* Code contribution: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/upstream-uni-code-contribution (coordinated by Kendall Nelson, diablo_rojo)

I would like to also kindly ask the training-guides project core reviewers to check the open reviews until the Summit more frequently to ensure we have the desired progress with updating the material.

Thanks and Best Regards,
Ildik?

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Request for ideas for WOO Sessions for
	Barcelona

Hey all,

I recently completed Outreachy Internship May-Aug 2016 round and got
accepted by Travel Support Program too.
I am really excited to attend my first OpenStack Summit.

I heard from past interns that there is a *meetup of Women of OpenStack
before the Day 1 of Summit.* But I can't see anything related mentioned
here[1].

Also is the etherpad link (listing ideas) for the same event? [2]

Can you please confirm? Also is there *any other event/meetup not mentioned
there which might be beneficial for us*?

schedule/#day=2016-10-25

[2] https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_Bacelona_Sessions_Ideas

Looking forward to hear from you. Thanks a lot!

Regards,
Nisha

There is no pre-Summit Women of OpenStack networking event scheduled for
Barcelona. Instead, we are planning on having a common women's meet-up area
at the Monday night booth crawl. More details including our popular Women
of OpenStack events guide will be published and made available to help
navigate our events in Barcelona.

Hey all,

I recently completed Outreachy Internship May-Aug 2016 round and got
accepted by Travel Support Program too.
I am really excited to attend my first OpenStack Summit.

I?heard from past interns that there is a?meetup of Women of OpenStack
before the Day 1 of Summit.?But I can't see anything related mentioned here
[1].

Also is the etherpad link (listing ideas) for the same event? [2]

Can you please confirm? Also is there?any other event/meetup not mentioned
there which might be beneficial for us?

[2]?https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_Bacelona_Sessions_Ideas

Looking forward to hear from you. Thanks a lot!

Regards,
Nisha

  Team,

  I'll add this idea to the etherpad: a session focused on the importance
  of diversity in innovation, using a string of TED-style talks from those
  across our community.? I'm working on this concept with Amy Marrich, and
  have reached out to some of you about participation--a big thank you for
  your interest!

  In addition, we did some filming in Austin for a video focused on
  diversity--many of you participated, thank you.? Here are a few initial
  rough cuts--we're considering a series of short clips leading up to the
  next summit, and then showing the clips at the summit.? If you're
  interested in using them in your own activities as well, please let me
  know!

  Folks -

  Rather than being catch as catch can about the WOO sponsored
  presentations -- besides I need to get some more input for the topics.
  I have created an Ether Pad for us to share ideas.? I would like to
  identify 2 or so panel topics and people who will volunteer to be on

Thanks for the update Jessica. I still have one query, can you please share
the *timing* of *the *common women's meet-up area at the Monday* night
booth crawl *you mentioned in above mail.

Actually, with fellow outreachy interns, I am planning a short trip near
Barcelona. So we would be grateful if you could enlighten us with rough/
estimated timings for above, as we don't wanna miss it either. So we can
reach near Summit place timely.

Thank you
Cheers,
Nisha

Answering for Jessica.  The WOO networking is when the booth crawl opens on day 1 of the summit. I just looked at the schedule and it does not post the time.
I am asking Erin Disney if she can comment on when the booth crawl events open.

Thanks for the update Jessica. I still have one query, can you please share the timing of the common women's meet-up area at the Monday night booth crawl you mentioned in above mail.

Actually, with fellow outreachy interns, I am planning a short trip near Barcelona. So we would be grateful if you could enlighten us with rough/ estimated timings for above, as we don't wanna miss it either. So we can reach near Summit place timely.

Thank you
Cheers,
Nisha

Hey all,

I recently completed Outreachy Internship May-Aug 2016 round and got accepted by Travel Support Program too.
I am really excited to attend my first OpenStack Summit.

I heard from past interns that there is a meetup of Women of OpenStack before the Day 1 of Summit. But I can't see anything related mentioned here[1].

Also is the etherpad link (listing ideas) for the same event? [2]

Can you please confirm? Also is there any other event/meetup not mentioned there which might be beneficial for us?

Looking forward to hear from you. Thanks a lot!

Regards,
Nisha

Team,

I'll add this idea to the etherpad: a session focused on the importance of diversity in innovation, using a string of TED-style talks from those across our community.  I'm working on this concept with Amy Marrich, and have reached out to some of you about participation--a big thank you for your interest!

In addition, we did some filming in Austin for a video focused on diversity--many of you participated, thank you.  Here are a few initial rough cuts--we're considering a series of short clips leading up to the next summit, and then showing the clips at the summit.  If you're interested in using them in your own activities as well, please let me know!

Folks -

Rather than being catch as catch can about the WOO sponsored presentations -- besides I need to get some more input for the topics.
I have created an Ether Pad for us to share ideas.  I would like to identify 2 or so panel topics and people who will volunteer to be on them. Don't forget that presentation submissions close Mid July so we want to get going!

Hi all,

Erin is in the air today so I?m chiming in as well. The pre-summit Marketplace Mixer happy hour will be on Monday, October 24, 5:00-7:00pm in the marketplace expo hall. This event is taking place the evening before the Summit content officially starts. It?s a great time to pick up your name badge, meet up with everyone else, check out the expo hall and then out in small groups to grab some dinner in the city. 

We?ll share the exact WOO designated Marketplace Mixer meet-up location and maps and everything else with you in early October. 

Stay tuned!

Thanks,
Claire

We plan to run the Women of OpenStack meet up at the same time as the booth
crawl on Monday, October 24 from 5pm-7pm (17:00-19:00) local time.

We are working with the foundation to finalize the time/location within the
booth crawl area and will post it to the mailing list when available. We
will also have signs posted at the event directing women to the area.

Thanks for the update Jessica. I still have one query, can you please share
the timing of the?common women's meet-up area at the?Monday?night booth
crawl you mentioned in above mail.

Actually, with fellow outreachy interns, I am planning a short trip near
Barcelona. So we would be grateful if you could enlighten us with rough/
estimated timings for above, as we don't wanna miss it either. So we can
reach near Summit place timely.

Thank you
Cheers,
Nisha

  Hey all,

  I recently completed Outreachy Internship May-Aug 2016 round and got
  accepted by Travel Support Program too.
  I am really excited to attend my first OpenStack Summit.

  I?heard from past interns that there is a?meetup of Women of OpenStack
  before the Day 1 of Summit.?But I can't see anything related mentioned
  here[1].

  Also is the etherpad link (listing ideas) for the same event? [2]

  Can you please confirm? Also is there?any other event/meetup not
  mentioned there which might be beneficial for us?

  Looking forward to hear from you. Thanks a lot!

  Nisha

        Team,

        I'll add this idea to the etherpad: a session focused on the
        importance of diversity in innovation, using a string of TED-style
        talks from those across our community.? I'm working on this concept
        with Amy Marrich, and have reached out to some of you about
        participation--a big thank you for your interest!

        In addition, we did some filming in Austin for a video focused on
        diversity--many of you participated, thank you.? Here are a few
        initial rough cuts--we're considering a series of short clips
        leading up to the next summit, and then showing the clips at the
        summit.? If you're interested in using them in your own activities
        as well, please let me know!

        Rather than being catch as catch can about the WOO sponsored
        presentations -- besides I need to get some more input for the
        topics.
        I have created an Ether Pad for us to share ideas.? I would like to
        identify 2 or so panel topics and people who will volunteer to be
        on them. Don't forget that presentation submissions close Mid July
        so we want to get going!

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Call for mentors and funding
Message-ID: <CAPfWQsqs7XM_8WR2XY8YE_upJRqHQWLsCzSpSVj7BF8y-4cGcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

An update on the Outreachy program, including a request for volunteer
mentors and funding. For those of you who are not aware, Outreachy helps
people from underrepresented groups get involved in free and open source
software  by matching interns with established mentors in the upstream
community. For more info, please visit:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy

We so far have a confirmation of one spot for OpenStack in this round of
Outreachy. But we are receiving more applicants who are interested in
contributing to different OpenStack projects. Interested mentors - please
publish your project ideas to this page
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Internship_ideas. Here is a link that helps
you get acquainted with mentorship process:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy/Mentors

We are looking for additional sponsors to help support the increase in
OpenStack applicants. The sponsorship cost is 6,500 USD per intern, which
is used to provide them a stipend for the three-month program. You can
learn more about sponsorship here:
https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/Admin/InfoForOrgs#Action

Outreachy has been one of the most important and effective diversity
efforts we?ve invested in. It has evidently been a way to retain new
contributors, we?ve had some amazing participants become long-term
contributors to our community.

Please help spread the word. If you are interested in becoming a mentor or
sponsoring an intern, please contact me (mahati.chamarthy AT intel.com) or
Victoria (victoria AT redhat.com).

Thanks,
Mahati

Women of OpenStack! Anyone can sign up who is interested in mentoring or in
need of a mentor!

Mentors! We can set you up as a technical mentor based on your areas of
expertise within the community or we can match you with a mentee looking
for more career advice.

Mentees! We have a variety of Stackers interested in giving you both
technical and career advice! We have mentors from a wide range of projects
and working groups willing to help you get involved in different aspects of
the community.

We would like to make as many matches before the Barcelona Summit as we can
so you can meet with your mentee/mentor there if you are both attending.

Thanks for sending to the WOO mailing list, Malini -- the Command Presence
workshop (Monday, October 24 9:30am-11:30am) is a great opportunity for
participants to get hands on, real time training on speaking in front of a
group. Helping women develop public speaking skills as well as giving them
speaking opportunities is a gap that has been discussed at each of our
summit working breakfast sessions since the Paris summit.

This is a great opportunity -- take advantage of it! You will walk out with
skills and confidence you did not know you had before the session.

Message-ID: <424c3f0f-9b91-2141-8ddb-35bb876e0bda@luthcomputer.com>

Folks - The WOS team will be welcoming folks as they register at the 
upcoming Summit in Barcelona.  We are looking for some volunteers to 
help with greeting people (not only women) to the Summit and share 
information about all the great WOS sponsored activities.  It is a great 
opportunity to meet new people and quickly get immersed in the spirit of 
the Summit!

I have volunteered to sign up some folks for this.   Ideally we need 1-2 
women each day starting on Sunday evening to hang out near the 
registration area.  We will have some flyers with information about the 
WOS sponsored events to hand out.  I am asking each of you to sign up 
for a 2 hour shift on each day of registration. Please contact me at 
bfcohen at luthcomputer.com for more details and to sign up.

More details about the shifts:
Sunday 4-7PM: 2 people

Monday 7-9AM:2 people needed

Monday 4-7PM:  Beth Cohen, 1 person needed

Tuesday 7-9AM: 2 people
