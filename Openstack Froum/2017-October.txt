Hello Everyone :)

With about a month left till the Sydney Summit, I'd like to kickoff another
round of Community Contributor Awards!

If you know someone that is awesome at replying to emails 24 hours a day-
nominate them! [1]

If you know someone that always puts the new contributors first and
dedicates time to getting them up to speed- nominate them! [1]

If you know someone that somehow is always able to fix the problem no
matter how ugly- nominate them! [1]

Basically nominate anyone you think deserves an award :) [1] There are a
lot of people out there that could use an extra pat on the back and this is
a good opportunity to get them a little extra recognition.

Please submit your candidates by
*October 27th. *

Winners will be announced at the feedback session in Sydney.

-Kendall Nelson (diablo_rojo)

Thanks Amy.

Also, as I mentioned during our last call (I think), as our next meetup I will be giving a brief update of the Pike release and some of the cool technology highlights. So in case you missed the awesome overview that Lauren and Jonathan gave last August, I will be presenting a subset of those slides tomorrow. Unlike our usual meetups, this meeting is ONLINE tomorrow morning (8am PDT) so you can all attend from whatever geo you reside in. The meetup is sponsored by Trilio and later on in the hour they will show a demo of how to properly protect and recover an OpenStack workload, which also may be of interest to you. Specifically what I will talk about during the first 15 minutes of the call is Cinder and Ironic, and the new features enhancing user experience, lifecycle management, scalability, and modularity. Cinder had a TON of cool updates, as I’m sure you know, like moving volumes back and forth within snapshots and taking VMs back to good known states, and increasing the size of cinder volumes without shutting down VMs. And Ironic with rolling upgrade support. Etc. Etc. I think I will also talk about the Python 3.5 update, since that will be interesting to operators (and effect EVERYBODY)!

So - if any of this sounds interesting to you, and you want to take 15 minutes out of your day tomorrow for a brief OpenStack Pike update, you can check out our agenda and info here: https://www.meetup.com/openstack/events/243811056/ <https://www.meetup.com/openstack/events/243811056/>

OR... if you want to hear the longer version of the presentation (30 mins) DIRECTLY from Lauren and Jonathan, you can revisit the OpenStack Marketing Pike Release Call here: https://www.openstack.org/marketing#tab=software <https://www.openstack.org/marketing#tab=software> and click on “Watch” for the Pike presentation. :) (And by the way, great job Jonathan and Lauren! LOTS of good info! :)

I’m happy to also answer questions about this on the WOO call today, if you have any.

Cheers,
Lisa

Hey Women of OpenStack!

I hope it’s OK to share this information in this forum…

One of our own—Anne McCormick of Cisco Systems—appeared on the Cloud Unfiltered podcast about ten days ago. Initially we planned to interview her about her work on Metacloud (an OpenStack-based private cloud solution), but instead wound up talking with her about women in tech.

It was a terrific discussion, where Anne touched on things like the Google Letter, Us vs. Them tribalism, and the microindiginities women deal with daily in the male-dominated tech world.

I really enjoyed it, and I thought some of you might as well. If you’d like to check it out, here are the links:

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Meetings - IRC?
Message-ID: <CAFs83QrGjr4zGspbRCozmEFU3bvXFLAi8jA+gGwbLAHuadsHRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

At the last meeting we discussed moving the meetings to IRC to be more in
line with all the other OpenStack groups and keeping with the 4 opens which
having logs of the meetings available is a part of. We also discussed still
holding the phone/webex meetings when we had presenters for the visual
aspects.

I wanted to see what the group's thoughts were on this change. I know we
had some challenges a few years ago and that's why we went to the phone
calls. We're willing to help folks get up and running on IRC if that's all
that's stopping someone from participating.

We hope this change would increase participation and depending on feedback
we might also look at changing the day or time of the meeting. There was
some feedback from those on the West Coast that with the next time change
the meetings would be during lunch.

Thanks,

Amy (spotz)

I fully support this move for several reasons:

1. The reasons Amy mentioned- in particular the Four Opens [1]. Currently,
our meetings aren't logged and there isn't any way to refer back except
with the etherpads- assuming someone was taking notes which isn't
guaranteed. Logs would help with planning events and knowing who took what
action item.

2. Phoneccall conversations are much more difficult for people who's first
language isn't English. Phone calls are also much more difficult for people
in timezones other than +/- 5 hours of the timezone the call is being held
in. More to that point- we should alternate IRC meeting times one more for
APAC and one more for US/Europe.

3. IRC meetings make it easier for multitasking. Personally, I find myself
in loud busy places quite often and don't want to join in/ go off mute for
fear of the loud background noise. I am however always on IRC and its easy
to respond in a meeting while in a loud airport or on public transit.

4. I don't know about you all, but speaking up on the phone can be hard
because I always feel like I am talking over someone or interrupting
someone. It's much easier to send a message in a meeting and not feel like
I am railroading over someone.

5. In talking to people at the Women of OpenStack Happy Hour at the PTG but
don't join in the meetings, the most common reason I heard was that they
hated that the meetings were on the phone and then started to list reasons
1-4 in various orders. This was in the range of a half a dozen to a dozen
women that would be involved more if they didn't have to call in.


For people that don't know how to get started with IRC there are two
options:
1. Webrowser like IRC cloud
2. IRC Client [2]

If you have any issues, please reply to this thread and I would be happy to
help- as I am sure many others would be as well :)

If you need some words of encouragement getting started, I wrote this
SuperUser Article about IRC a while back[3].

Thanks Amy for getting this thread going, you have my +2 :)

Currently, our meetings aren't logged and there isn't any way to refer back except with the etherpads- assuming someone was taking notes which isn't guaranteed. Logs would help with planning events and knowing who took what action item.

In talking to people at the Women of OpenStack Happy Hour at the PTG but don't join in the meetings, the most common reason I heard was that they hated that the meetings were on the phone and then started to list reasons 1-4 in various orders.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] [summit] Call for mentors (and mentees) for
	Speed Mentoring in Sydney
Message-ID: <OF1DDDD7AD.F07436BD-ON002581B6.00735BB8-852581B7.000DE8BA@notes.na.collabserv.com>


Hello,
We are so pleased to again offer Speed Mentoring on the first day of the
Sydney summit. We're looking for mentors of all types who can join us for
lunch. Please consider taking a few hours to help out and give advice to
people new and not so new to the community.


            Speed Mentoring Lunch - Monday November 8, 12:15-1:30PM
            We're looking for 10-20 mentors, women and men alike, who are
            interested in offering either technical, career, or (new for
            this summit!!) community advice.





            What’s Required?


            You'll meet with small groups of mentees in 10-minute intervals
            and answer their questions about how to grow in the community.
            It's a fast-paced event and a great way to meet new people,
            introduce them to the summit, and welcome them into the
            OpenStack community. Mentors will be provided with mentee
            questions in advance and should plan to arrive at noon.  Lunch
            will be provided!


            We will contact mentors ahead of time and hold a short call to
            go over logistics of the event shortly before the summit.


            Sign up here -
            https://www.openstack.org/summit/sydney-2017/summit-schedule/events/20369/speed-mentoring-lunch-hosted-by-the-women-of-openstack






            We also have room for plenty of mentees, so please encourage
            anyone new (or not so new) to the community to sign up!



            Thanks in advance!
Sincerely,
Emily Kate Hugenbruch

Hey all!

The Git and Gerrit Lunch and Learn is back on the schedule for Wednesday
during the lunch break. If you will be in Sydney and are available to come
help it would be much appreciated. All room helpers (and their companies)
will get some credit on one of the slides if you need a little proof for
your bosses.

Let me know if you can help!

Thanks,

Hello Stackers!

Sorry for the late notice. We will be meeting Monday at our normal time. We'll be doing some summit planning, and recap some of the open action items like moving the meeting to IRC, OpenStack Days, Mentoring, etc.

Meeting time: 
2000 UTC, 4 PM EDT, 3 PM CDT, 2 PM MDT, 1 PM PDT

Dial In: 1-203-277-8157 <(203)%20277-8157> or *866-619-0383
<(866)%20619-0383>  Participant: 7217256**#* Leader 4018#


See full agenda (and add to it) here:
Etherpad: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_10_16_17 <https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_10_16_17>

Unfortunately I have a time conflict so I’ve added my input on the Etherpad already and will continue to follow along after the meeting. 

Amy M. will step (back) in to run the meeting during the hour. Hope everyone can make it on Monday for our second-to-last meeting before Summit! :)

Cheers,
-Lisa

Hey everyone,

Started an etherpad at https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOO_sydney_events
for WoO related talks and events, please add your talks or others you know
of. I'm thinking talks but not forum or on-boarding rooms but if the group
feels we should spread the word on those too they can definitely be
included.

Thanks,

I signed up for one of the moderator spots.

Looking forward to it!

Hi All,


Here’s your reminder about our regular Women of OpenStack meeting.

We will be meeting tomorrow at our normal time.

This is the LAST meeting before the Summit, so please try and attend so we can make sure we are all in sync.

This may also be our LAST meeting before moving to IRC on Nov 13. So for tomorrow (Monday), please dial in the usual way at the usual time:

(2000 UTC???), 4 PM EDT, 3 PM CDT, 2 PM MDT, 1 PM PDT
I believe some of the world has already turned their clocks, like in England, so please note that we have NOT changed our clocks yet in the US. The call tomorrow is at 1pm PDT.

Dial In: 1-203-277-8157 <(203)%20277-8157> or *866-619-0383
<(866)%20619-0383>  Participant: 7217256**#* Leader 4018#


Etherpad: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_10_30_17 <https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_10_30_17>

See you tomorrow (Monday)!

Cheers,
Lisa

Hi everyone,

Starting on November 13 at 20:00 UTC we will have our first meeting held in
the #openstack-women channel on Freenode. If you'd like to get a ping on
the channel for the meeting please add your IRC nick to

https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Women_of_OpenStack#Work_Group_Meeting_information

Looking forward to seeing everyone there. And don't forget you can hang on
the channel even when there's NOT a meeting!:)

Thanks Amy!

I added my nics :)

To everyone else, if you need help getting set up in IRC I added some links
to last weeks agenda[1] towards the bottom in the notes. If you need more
help, send me an email and I will help get you set up.

See you all on IRC!
