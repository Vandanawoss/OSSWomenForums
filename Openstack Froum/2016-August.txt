Hi,

Thank you Victoria for starting this thread (http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/women-of-openstack/2016-July/000634.html). Unfortunately I don?t have the mails as I joined to the list late, but I used the same subject with some additional tags.

I got involved with the Upstream University activities in Austin, where I was one of the presenters at the training before the event. Starting from this week I?m joining the OpenStack Foundation team and I would like to continue with this involvement as one of my focus areas.

With the presenters and a few mentors we started an activity after the last Summit to collect feedback and get our heads around how we could improve the training material, orgainzation, experience of both attendees and presenters, etc. I recognized an ongoing activity around the training-guides, which contains the training material, and we have as mentioned earlier the mentor and internship programs connecting this in some extent as well.

In order to try to consolidate the parallel efforts I created an etherpad, where I listed a few items in connection with the training and I also added a section for the mentoring programs: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/upstream-university-improvements
I included the feedbacks we collected as well.

Please add your name if you would like to participate in any of the related activities. Also please feel free to extend the lists or add comments to the items. :)

Thanks and Best Regards,
Ildik?

Hi Matjaz,

Great, thanks much.

It would be great to connect the activities around this area and have joint efforts. I wanted to join the Training guides meeting last week, but it seemed to be cancelled. Do you still hold them?

Thanks,
Ildik?

I think in my case it's not so much graduation criteria (I'm not judging my
mentee) but releasing mentors to mentor others since that's the resource
we're running out of and want to treat like gold. :)

I could see timing as being a decent criteria for defining each program.
Then all I'd suggest is -- Duration: six months between Summits as the
definition for WOO light-weight mentoring + Speed-mentoring.

That's very fair, to establish it based on timing, and that would help
avoid burnout.  You're right that mentors are our most precious resource
here.
For graduation criteria, we had been thinking more along the lines of:
   Did the mentee achieve a goal that they wanted to, like getting a piece
   of code done, or getting to a new job?
   Is the mentee ready to be a mentor themselves?
But we were planning to continue the discussion tomorrow, so we'll
definitely bring up the 6 month timeframe suggestion then.

FYI, our meeting etherpad, if anyone wants to see the log of our
discussions on the topic
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_mentoring_12_3, or if you have more
suggestions for us to discuss at our Wednesday meeting.
Thanks!

  Thanks for all the efforts.

  One outcome I'd like to see from the WOO mentoring is a duration and
  end-date for the mentoring. Should it be close to the 3-months of the
  Outreachy program, or 6 months, Summit-to-Summit, or for a year? By
  letting mentors know when they are freed from one mentoring commitment
  they can then be ready for another round.

  Thanks,

     Hi all,

     The OpenStack Summit is rapidly approaching and I wanted to chat about
     the different mentoring efforts that are happening in the OpenStack
     community before it in order to unite forces and make the best for all
     of them.

     As the OpenStack Summit in Austin we had

     - Mentoring within internships like Outreachy and Google Summer of
     Code
     -- Duration: 3 month length
     -- Target: Underrepresented groups/Students respectively interested in
     contributing to OpenStack
     -- Mentors: Volunteers each round, not fixed list
     -- Coordinators: vkmc, mahatic, devdatta, dims
     - WOO light-weight mentoring + Speed-mentoring
     -- Duration: Not defined
     -- Target: People getting involved with OpenStack, with no prior
     experience in contributing to open source
     -- Mentors: DB of mentors
     -- Coordinators: ekhugen
     - Upstream Training
     -- Duration: 2 days training before OpenStack Summit
     -- Target: People getting involved with OpenStack, with no prior
     experience in contributing to open source
     -- Mentors: Volunteers each edition, not fixed list
     -- Coordinators: Volunteers each edition, not sure how this is defined

     How can we merge all the efforts together?

     Now, with regards to Upstream Training for the OpenStack Summit. Is
     there any update about this training? Who is taking the lead this
     time? I see that [0] shows information from latest round. Ildiko and I
     wanted to join this edition too and we want to be ready to help
     whenever we can with it.

     Best,

     Victoria

Hi,

I would like to point you to the recent additions on the training etherpad: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/upstream-university-improvements

There is a ?Content structure? section that contains a basic collection of topics to include in the training. It is also sorted into two main groups, the first one contains the common items and the second lists a few areas that we can consider as modules, which we can have in parallel in smaller groups if we have people interested in those and also mentors who can help with those parts.

There is also a suggestion on the etherpad to try to use PBL (Problem-based Learning) [1]. I think it would be great to consider as it seems a good technique to introduce the students the environment they will work in when they start their journey with OpenStack and they will more likely learn how to solve problems on their own after the training.

It would be great to have better tooling around this event as well, so we also have a proposal on a user interface we could use to coordinate and notify both students/mentees and mentors. [2][3][4]

If you have any further ideas or comments on the content, UI/tooling proposal or PBL please share it in this thread or on the etherpad.

The next steps are:
* agree on the end goals
   * training style/format
   * content
   * tooling
* define tasks and start working on the above items

@Matjaz: If I?m not mistaken the next Training Guides team meeting is scheduled for next Monday. Could we use that to go through the etherpad and on the items I listed in this mail?

If anyone would like to join this activity please add your name and contact info to the training etherpad! :)

Thanks and Best Regards,
Ildik?

It seems that my sent e-mail was filtered to mailing lists because there

So I am forwarding it to two mailing lists!

Hello Ildiko,

Thanks a lot for sharing the meeting notes, and sorry for not
participating in the last meeting.
(It was 2:00 AM locally, and this constraint sometimes prevent me from
attending the meeting.)

I have read all of them, and it is so nice! I would like to propose the
followings:

1) I generally agree with our on-going steps, but I would like to more
encourage participants to prepare
such development environment, although we will provide it as a virtual
machine.
So it would be much better if we specify 'Prerequisites' or
'Preparation' on the upstream training registration page,
rather than announcing 'How to prepare' page (
http://docs.openstack.org/upstream-training/#how-to-prepare ) after the
registration.

2) I am not sure if there is 'OpenStack Sandbox' launchpad which is
linked to our sandbox repository
http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-dev/sandbox .
Such launchpad would be nice for exercise, rather than dealing with
triaging and changing bug status on real OpenStack project bugs.


With many thanks,

/Ian

It would be a great way of getting some or maybe all of the content work done for example if we have enough participants. The ideal time would be early September which should give us enough time to finish whatever has left for Barcelona still in time. The preferred length would be 3 days.

Hi All,

First of all thank you everyone, it?s really good to see we?re having progress! :)

@Ian: Thanks for adding notes to the etherpad.

Regarding preparation, do you mean to encourage people to put together a dev env for themselves to specify it a prerequisite? I think we can communicate what we decide in the notification mail that they get after registration. I prefer adding questions to the registration page to see what people?s expectations are rather than prerequisites.

I think a Sandbox Launchpad page would be good for practice. It would also be nice to teach people how to find bugs that they will most likely be able to fix and which are really worth to fix at the same time and guide them through the process through those. But we can discuss this topic further.

@Mark: Thanks for the script and sharing the Github page. I added the link and your notes to our etherpad.

I would like to encourage everyone who has some time to try it out and give feedback either regarding how easy it was to use or about improvements, bugs, etc.!

I also added a section on remote content sprint to the etherpad. It would be great if the few of us who?re working on this could have some dedicated time to work on the missing pieces and being able to sync up. I proposed a time period and goals. Please add your thoughts and preferences to the section as well.

If you have any questions, comments or further topics/ideas please add them to the etherpad or reply to this thread.

Thanks and Best Regards,
Ildik?

Hello!

@Ildiko,

I agree with your idea: adding questions to the registration page to see 
expectations :)

@Mark,

I have executed it on my Windows 10 and also Mac OS X environment. The 
followings are my brief feedback and thoughts:

- DevStack installation and execution work so fine :) And it was easy!
- I would recommend to enable "Reinitialize the MAC address of all 
network cards" option when importing the virtual appliance using VirtualBox.
- There is a warning: "The shared folder 'vagrant' could not be set up: 
Shared folder path 
'/home/oro/projects/_github.com/kmARC/openstack-training-virtual-environment' 
is not absolute."
- It seems that DevStack source is already stored in the OVA file. We 
might need to guide users to execute 'git pull' to retrieve the latest 
DevStack source.
- No port forwarding and additional host-only network interface prevent 
users from accessing Horizon on users' host OS environment.
  (e.g., the connection from Internet Explorer (out of VirtualBox) to 
Horizon (executing in the virtual machine) is not supported.)
- If we might use old OVA images during upstream training (as fresh as 
possible would be nice but freshest DevStack environment would be so 
ideal), then making DevStack offline (using 'OFFLINE=True' option in 
local.conf) would be also nice to less use network bandwidth.


With many thanks,

/Ian

Hello!

I'm excited to let everyone know that the "PTLs and Cores: We are Not
as Scary as You Think - Sponsored by the Women of OpenStack"
presentation has been scheduled for Tuesday 25 October at 5:05 pm. I
hope to see everyone there!
https://www.openstack.org/summit/barcelona-2016/summit-schedule/events/15499/ptls-and-cores-we-are-not-as-scary-as-you-think-sponsored-by-the-women-of-openstack


Jessica Murillo and I are asking for suggestions on the PTLs and Cores
that should be on the panel. We are looking for leaders who value
diversity and inclusion and would offer a balanced view of what it
takes to build technical eminence in the Community. Please everyone
add your suggestions to this etherpad:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_PTL_Core_Suggestions

Our goal is to create a fun panel that imparts a lot of great
information on how to communicate effectively with PTLs/Cores as well
as best practices for contributing. Feel free to add items you would
like to see covered in this presentation to the etherpad above.

Thanks everyone!

Hello,

@Mark,

For a newcomer, a desktop screen with basic explanation on the environment
(e.g., default user ID, default password, "/opt/stack" directory + 
upstream training logo if it is okay)
like http://www.flickr.com/photos/31838982 at N08/7798881316/ (I searched 
on Google) would be nice I think.

For network connectivity on OpenStack instances, I usually used the 
following command. I am sure it will work well
: $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

@Ildiko,

IMO testing virtual machine environment is also a good topic for our 
sprint, so I updated on Etherpad.
And will our sprint be a kind virtual sprint, like 
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/VirtualSprints ?

Yes, wallpaper! That's exactly what I thought. Thanks for expressing

I thought two network interfaces (one: NAT - Internet, the other: 
Host-only - VM access from the host)
and a simple iptable rule would be sufficient. Would this environment 
not be sufficient?

Hi Ian,

Thanks for the link for the sprint.

I think we can make it 100% official and post on the wiki page as well. The idea is to have dedicated time, when we focus on content, exercises, environment, etc. We need to decide the scope and define goals for the sprint and work on to achieve those.

After talking to a few people mid- or second half of next week seems like a good target, e.g. Sept 6-8 or 7-9. I think that gives us enough time to figure out the sprint goals and it?s still in time from the Summit/training perspective, so we can either have another round of this if needed or work more offline on remaining items.

What do you think?

Best Regards,
Ildik?

Hello Ildiko,

Great!

But unfortunately, due to my personal schedule, approximately, Sep 7 
12:00 UTC - 9 12:00 UTC will not be available for me.

Would it be okay to have a sprint on around Sep 10-15?


With many thanks,

/Ian

Hi Ian,

Thanks for sharing your availability.

I created a Doodle poll with dates: http://doodle.com/poll/geaq6fdsg749nsnc <http://doodle.com/poll/geaq6fdsg749nsnc>  Anyone who?s interested, please add your availability if you?re interested to participate.

I think we can aim for multiple shorter periods rather than one long one as we have multiple areas to improve. I would like to have well defined areas  like:

* Updating the common content
* Work on the exercises for the code contribution block
* Work on content and exercises for the Documentation contribution block
* Finalise and test the Dev env.
* Etc.

If possible it would be great to have drivers for each of these blocks. We can then decide based on people?s availability to what to work on in a more focused way and when and we also need to define goals to see what progress we made.

What do you think?

Thanks,
Ildik?
