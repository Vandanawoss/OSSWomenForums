and Women of OpenStack session
<https://www.openstack.org/videos/barcelona-2016/women-of-openstack-breakfast-sponsored-by-ibm>
in the Barcelona Summit. A big thanks to Emily Hugenbruch, Nithya Ruff and
Jessica Murillo for their valuable insights. I also presented a talk OpenStack
Outreachy Internships
<https://www.openstack.org/videos/barcelona-2016/a-dice-with-several-faces-coordinators-mentors-and-interns-on-openstack-outreachy-internships>

At the Boston Summit, I would be glad to volunteer at the Speed Mentoring
session or any other Women of OpenStack event, sharing my experience.
Please le'me know if I can signup for the same or there's anything else I
can help with.

P.S. I recently wrote a beginner's guide to attend OpenStack Summit. Please
have a look here

Waiting for kind reply. Thanks.

Message-ID: <CABGKpcGYJ7B5K69iJWdGL2MFSd0PDLOuRS9aJ1VZJYyXRR=QTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,
I am unable to add myself to the list here,

https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Women_of_OpenStack#Women_of_OpenStack_Directory

Getting the following error, even when I am not adding any link.
Spam protection filter

The text you wanted to save was blocked by the spam filter. This is
probably caused by a link to a blacklisted external site.

The following text is what triggered our spam filter: Facebook.


Please help me fix this issue. Thanks a lot!

Regards,

Nisha

Yes, I get the same thing. I think the spam filter has blocked any edits to
the page. I've removed the two keywords that seemed to trigger. Had to
change a reference to gmail to gee mail, and remove Facebook mention and
link.

Try again and see if you can edit now.
Hope this helps -
Anne

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to remind everyone the next meeting will be today 3/6/17 at
12pm PST, 2pm CST and 3pm EST.

Dial-in info is: 1-203-277-8157 <(203)%20277-8157> or 866-619-0383
<(866)%20619-0383>  Participant: 7217256# Leader 4018#

Etherpad is at https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_03_06_17 and if you
would like to add something to the agenda please do so. I've thrown a few
topics on that I think wed like to at least touch base on. On today's
agenda is  "My experience @ the PTG with speakers Aimee Ukasick & Kendall
Nelson"

I've gone ahead and fleshed out the next couple of meetings at
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_Agenda_Tracker so please sign up if
you'd like to lead a meeting. It's a great way to get some experience
leading and talking to a group in a very low key environment (we don't
bite).

Hope everyone had a good break!

Thanks,

Amy

Hey Anne,

I am sorry to ping you again. But the same issue arises when I try to edit
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy#Mentors
Can you please help me with this? Or if I can do something to fix the
issue, that would work as well.

Even adding a single alphabet gives the following error,
Spam protection filter

The text you wanted to save was blocked by the spam filter. This is
probably caused by a link to a blacklisted external site.

The following text is what triggered our spam filter: gmail.



Thanks and regards,
Nisha

No worries, I should have been more clear previously.

To fix it yourself, look for "gmail" in the page and edit it to "gee mail"
or something. It's a bit of a pain if the best way to get in touch with
someone is through gmail, but hopefully people will still be able to
interpret the non-spammy wording.

Hey,
Sure will do that, but I wanted to know more. Should we consider it as a
temporary quick fix or is it due to some recent spam filtering changes in
the wiki page. Because, last time someone would have added their email
address mentioning gmail the changes did in fact got saved, right? I don't
really know how the editing of wiki page really works. Sorry if I am
bugging you.

Regards,
Nisha

Anne, I edited the wiki page. I first removed the last occurrence of gmail.
Added myself to the list along with my 'gmail' address and it got saved.
Then, I again edited the wiki page, reversing the former occurence of gmail
to how it was initially. It worked, though I am still wondering why.

Thanks for help once again!

Hi again Nisha -

I asked Jeremy Stanley on the Infra team if there was a "window" of time
that gmail would be a blocked word. Sounds like it's a keyword within their
control (some are controlled by Mediawiki itself), so he unblocked it
earlier today. You can read more context, around this timestamp, from the
IRC logs if you're curious:
http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack-infra/%23openstack-infra.2017-03-06.log.html#t2017-03-06T17:26:07

So my best guess is that you hit the timing just right. :)

Anne

Hi Nisha,
Great guide to the summit!  Thanks so much for the shout out to Speed
Mentoring!
We are organizing another Speed Mentoring session for first thing on Monday
morning in Boston and we'd love to have you help.  We're going to put out a
call for mentors shortly, or if you're interested in helping with the
session organization, please let me know.  FYI the mentoring team meets
Wednesdays at 2000 UTC on openstack-meeting and all are welcome!
Thanks!

Hey all,

I attended the the Speed Mentoring session and Women of OpenStack session
in the Barcelona Summit. A big thanks to Emily Hugenbruch, Nithya Ruff and
Jessica Murillo for their valuable insights. I also presented a talk
OpenStack Outreachy Internships

At the Boston Summit, I would be glad to volunteer at the Speed Mentoring
session or any other Women of OpenStack event, sharing my experience.
Please le'me know if I can signup for the same or there's anything else I
can help with.

P.S. I recently wrote a beginner's guide to attend OpenStack Summit. Please
have a look here.

Waiting for kind reply. Thanks.

	Speed Mentoring

Hello,
We are so pleased to?again offer?Speed Mentoring on the first morning of
the Boston summit. We're looking?for mentors of all types who can?join us
for part of the morning. Please consider taking a few hours to help out and
give advice to people new?and not so new to the community.


            Speed Mentoring Breakfast sponsored by Intel -?Monday May
            8,?7:30-8:45AM
            We're looking for 10-20 mentors,?women and men alike, who are
            interested in offering either technical or career advice.





            What?s Required?


            You'll meet with small groups of mentees in?15-minute?intervals
            and answer their questions about how to grow in the community.
            It's a fast-paced event and a great way to meet new people,
            introduce them to the summit,?and welcome them into the
            OpenStack community. Mentors?will be provided with mentee
            questions in advance and?should plan to arrive at?7:15AM.
            Breakfast and caffeine will be provided!


            We will contact mentors ahead of time and hold a short call to
            go over logistics of the event shortly before the summit.


            Sign up here -
            https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/boston_woo_speed_mentoring_baseballcard_info
              We'll use this information to create fun baseball cards for
            each mentor, like this one from the Barcelona summit for
            super-mentor Andrew Mitry?(See attached file:
            AndrewMitryMentorTradingCard.pdf)



            Thanks in advance for volunteering!
Sincerely,
Emily Kate Hugenbruch

Hi Janki,
There's no selection process, if you applied, we're happy to have you.  In
the unlikely event we get too many mentors signed up, we'll just close down
the survey to new signups.  We're expecting to have the logistics call
sometime around April 17.  Thanks!

While the Women of OpenStack events aren't on the summit schedule yet it's
time to start thinking about helping out!

We will be looking for 4-8 people to assist participants in the room with
their Git and Gerrit configurations if they run into trouble. If you or
anyone you know are available to help let me know, and as soon as we know
the day and time I'll pass that information out.

Remember all helpers will be placed on a slide with their company's logo so
if you need a little something extra to get your boss to let you go this is
it!

Thanks,

Amy

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to remind everyone the next meeting will be today 3/20/17 at
1pm PST, 3pm CST and 4pm EST. This new meeting time is *1 hour later *due
to DST.

Dial-in info is: 1-203-277-8157 <(203)%20277-8157> or 866-619-0383
<(866)%20619-0383>  Participant: 7217256# Leader 4018#

Etherpad is at https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_03_20_17 and if you
would like to add something to the agenda please do so. I've thrown a few
topics on that I think we'd like to at least touch base on.

I've gone ahead and fleshed out the next couple of meetings at https://
etherpad.openstack.org/p/WOS_Agenda_Tracker so please sign up if you'd like
to lead a meeting. It's a great way to get some experience leading and
talking to a group in a very low key environment (we don't bite).

And again remember NEW meeting time due to time change

Thanks,

Amy

Hi all,

I would like to contribute to any OpenStack or OPNFV project by writing the
unit tests, can anyone suggest which project will be suitable as a starter?
I have a background in NFV related areas.
Another question is whether is it possible to get any mentor to work with
if you are not part of outreachy or any such platform, just for guidance
and help from time to time?

Thanks,

Aqsa,

Welcome!!! I'm sure most groups would be open to help with their unit
tests, is there an area that interests you? What coding language do you
like?

As far as mentoring there is the Women of OpenStack mentoring program which
I believe is taking applications again or will be shortly. If you're going
to Summit there will be a Speed Mentoring session as well.

Most groups will answer questions on their IRC channel and help you, I know
my main project is great for that. There will also be Project On-Boarding
rooms for many projects at Summit, there are more groups interested then
rooms unfortunately.

Thanks,

Amy

Hi Amy,

Thanks for your email. I am most comfortable with working in python. I have
been contributing in Tacker by solving bugs but I feel it is better to have
more stable contribution rather than jumping from one bug to another in
various projects.
Writing unit tests feels like the best option as per my interests.

As for the mentoring program unfortunately I can't apply in it as I have a
full time position at NEC Europe. I have applied for the travel support
program for the Summit if I can make it.
I can start with writing unit tests in Tacker, but I will appreciate to
know any OPNFV projects which are looking for dedicated people for this
task.

Aqsa

Aqsa,

Most folks in the Mentoring Program do have full-time jobs, here is a link
for more information https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mentors.

And please don't discount the need for solving bugs, that is actually where
a lot of development goes as they may not just be bugs but new work to be
done as well. If you've been doing Tracker bugs and like that project I
would highly recommend joining their IRC channel and attending their
meetings.

Thanks,

Amy

Hi Aqsa,

First of all a warm welcome from me too we are happy to have you on board! :)

I?m glad you reached out for guidance on getting more involved in the community and being more strategic. As Amy pointed out bug fixing is a really important activity and while finding a more complex task for you to work on please don?t quit doing that.

I?m working for the OpenStack Foundation where one of my focus areas is Telecom/NFV, I?m also involved in the OPNFV Community. I would be happy to help you find an interesting project and/or task to work on in a more focused way. I?m in Central European Time time zone, which should make it easier for us to communicate.

In order to find the best fit, I would like to better understand what your areas of interest are within NFV. Would you be available to have a short chat about it? You can find me on IRC as ildikov, feel free to ping me any time that works for you.

I also hope for the best for the travel support program! In addition to the main events there are several smaller OpenStack events around Europe and around the globe called OpenStack Days [1]. Are you planning to attend any of those?

Thanks and Best Regards,
Ildik?

Thanks a lot to all you amazing ladies. Its a pity why I didn't reach out
earlier. But better late than never.

Amy: thanks for pointing out, I had no idea they take people with a full
time job as well. I am on it now. :)

Aimee: That's just wonderful piece of information you shared, exactly the
pointers I was looking for. I'll have a thorough look at Models and get in
touch.

Ildik?: I might attend the one in London but not sure about that right now.
Plus I really appreciate your offering for help, I'll definitely get in
touch via IRC because I really could do with such kind of guidance.

Kind Regards,
Aqsa

Hello Aqsa,

Welcome to the community! Glad to know of your interest!

I happened to see your cross post in the Outreachy mailing list. If you're
interested in applying for the Outreachy internship program as a
participant (and not as a mentor), it is indeed true that one cannot be
working full time. Please have a look here for guidelines -
https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/#Eligibility

The other mentoring programs over here -
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mentors do not seem to have that criteria.
I hope this info helps.

Best,
Mahati

Sounds great, I will be attending the London one so hopefully see you there the latest. :)

Looking forward to chatting with you on IRC!

Welcome, Aqsa.

I'm the Executive Director of OPNFV; it's great to hear about your interest
in NFV, OpenStack, and testing! OpenStack is one of our core upstream
technologies.

Ildiko is a great person to give you direct technical guidance -- she is
well immersed in both the technology and both communities. If you'd like to
chat with me as well, I'd be more than happy to. I can be found on IRC w/
the handle hkirksey, usually lurking in the #opnfv-meeting room, or I'm
happy to set up a call.

And while I'm at it (since I often lurk here) I really do have to say that
I've been continuously impressed with OpenStack's focus on diversity and by
this group.

Cheers,
Heather

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Encouraging more women to take the COA
Message-ID: <8A9CFE46-0E2F-4782-A502-AD6F0D7ACFEE@openstack.org>

Hi all,

Anne Bertucio from the OpenStack Foundation?s COA program here. The Certified OpenStack Administrator program has been growing since its kickoff last April, but the percentage of women taking the exam is below the typical numbers for WOO representation. I want to encourage you all to consider the exam; I would love to see the number better reflect the strong presence of WOO. We?re seeing an increasing number of companies ask for COAs, and opportunities for COAs continues to grow. 

If you?re headed to the Boston Summit, you can take the COA onsite, save $50 off the typical exam fee, and be a Certified OpenStack Administrator by the time you leave Boston! You do need to pre-reg; no walkup or onsite registration is available: https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/coa-in-boston <https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/coa-in-boston> 

If you want to learn more first, swing by a Summit talk about the COA by WOO?s own Amy Marrich and Holly Bazemore: https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/summit-schedule/global-search?t=COA <https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017/summit-schedule/global-search?t=COA>

Drop me a line at anytime if you have questions, comments, or suggestions on how we can better bring the COA to WOO.   

Best,
Anne Bertucio
