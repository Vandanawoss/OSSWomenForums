Hello again, wonderful women of OpenStack! I will be teaching the Ally
Skills Workshop, and thanks to your help, we are nearly at capacity. Thank
you!

Claire and I would like to encourage a few more women to take the remaining
spots at the workshop. A crucial part of the workshop is women sharing
their knowledge and experiences (and men listening), and we would really
appreciate your help. If you were interested in attending but didn't want
to take up a spot, now is the time to register
<https://adainitiative.org/2015/04/register-now-ally-skills-workshop-at-openstack-summit-2015/>
!

https://adainitiative.org/2015/04/register-now-ally-skills-workshop-at-openstack-summit-2015/

Here are some things women in particular have said about attending this
workshop:

"Hearing [my co-workers] discuss power and privilege in the workplace, and
the various "a?ha!" moments people had, were very encouraging and made me
feel heard and encouraged."

"I loved the open dialogue of this workshop, and the fact that it wasn't a
discussion of whether issues of sexism exist, but how to deal with the fact
that they do."

"It was a great workshop. I liked pretty much everything." (!!! not a
plant!)

See you at one of the many great Women of OpenStack events next week!

-VAL

Yes, #WomenofOpenStack seems logical if long. The abbreviation though would
be unfortunate, we don't really seem like WoO girls. ;-)

Other suggestions?

I posted this to the LinkedIn group but also wanted to send it out to the

*****

If you were unable to attend the Summit, held last week in Vancouver,
recordings of all the session talks and keynotes are online. I want to
highlight the record of the Women of OpenStack Panel, Standing Tall in the
Room. I had the great pleasure of speaking on this panel with 4 other
amazing women (Nalee Jang, Elizabeth Joseph, Radha Ratnaparkhi and Shilla
Saebi ) and our fearless leader and moderator, Beth Cohen.

Alexandra Settle was not able to make it to Vancouver from Australia, but
has a featured post on rackspace.com blog discussing the history of the WOS
group, a summar of the panel discussion, and a call to join the group. The
post can be found here:

Hi All,

At the women of OpenStack breakfast working session it was mentioned that
there is a diversity working group developing. Does anyone have any further
information on that? A wiki page perhaps or somewhere I can go to find more
details? Thank you!

Hi Shilla,

The Diversity Working Group was just created/approved on May 17 at the Foundation board meeting in Vancouver. It?s spearheaded by board members Imad, Kavit and Egle. 

The Foundation staff and board need to sync-up to create a clear and consistent path for community members who want to learn more and get involved in this new working group. 

I?m sure a wiki page and other information will be shared with both the Community and Women of OpenStack mailing lists soon. 

Thanks for proactively reaching out!

Cheers,
Claire

A note of thanks to the women-of-openstack mailing list. Through this list, I connected with Jeanne Colon-Bonet, who was putting together a panel submission for the Vancouver Summit. I jumped at the chance and feel extremely fortunate that I had the opportunity to speak in Vancouver. I learned a great deal from my fellow panelists: Angela Brown, Jeanne Colon-Bonet, Sharon Cordesse and Gary Kevorkian. I likely wouldn?t have submitted anything on my own and want to say THANK YOU to Jean and the women-of-openstack mailing list for bringing us together.

Hi Women of OpenStack,

This is the first time I've participated in this mailing lists. The topic caught my attention because I attended the panel discussion at OpenStack Summit and learned a great deal from all of the panelist's experiences in the cloud community and crafting Open Source events. I learned that knowing who your attendee audience will be is crucial when planning out event activities and the tone to the event. I sometimes work alongside Jeanne at HP events and the amount of effort, patience, and planning she puts into events is astounding. So a big THANK YOU to all the panelists, Jeanne, Angela, Sharon, Liz, and Gary.

Hi Women of Openstack,
  I recently joined the mailing list and have already gotten great benefits
from other members!  I was wondering if anyone knew of city openstack meet
ups around the Greenville, SC area or surrounding cities.  Would love to
start a monthly get together with other fellow WOO if there's not already
one.

Thanks everyone!

Hi Women of Openstack,
? I recently joined the mailing list and have already gotten great benefits
from other members!? I was wondering if anyone knew of city openstack meet
ups around the Greenville, SC area or surrounding cities.? Would love to
start a monthly get together with other fellow WOO if there's not already
one.

Thanks everyone!

Message-ID: <CADeXowjbuDejV52D6BFc-z-vkA3-sw4bh4hkHcndWdp7XUigOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello ladies,

This is my first email to the women of openstack mailing list and I hope
I'll find some support here.

My name is Sara and i'm an engineering student In France. Right Now i'm
doing my final intership before graduation and I'm working on Openstack. I
need to scale some VMs based on CPU, RAM and Network workloads combined. I
started with basic things. Now my VMs can scale up and down based on CPU.
BUT when I try to connect them to a load balancer nothing works.

I really need to make this first step work.So for those of you who already
played with autoscaling, can you please provide me with clues , examples,
tutos I can use to do a first demo for my team?!


Looking forward to hearing from you,
Sara

P.S: find attached my templates

I am also interested in attending OpenStack meet ups in the San

meetings in the bay area. If you know of any or if anyone has done this 
before, let me know the details.

Thanks,

>> Hi Women of Openstack,

I was wondering if anyone knew of city openstack meet ups around the Greenville, SC area or surrounding cities.  Would love to start a monthly get together with other fellow WOO if there's not already one.
