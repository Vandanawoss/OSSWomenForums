Message-ID: <D1EA9FD9.1B48C%egle.sigler@rackspace.com>

Hello,

Thanks everyone that joined us yesterday on IRC for our meeting. The next meeting will be Thursday, August 13 at 5:00 UTC.

Here are the notes from our meeting: http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/meetings/diversity_working_group_5/2015/diversity_working_group_5.2015-08-06-17.01.html

Take aways:

  *   We are meeting at two different times on alternating weeks. If you have not signed up for the foundation at lists.openstack.org<mailto:foundation at lists.openstack.org> mailing list, please do so: http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/foundation
  *   Travel support program deadline for Tokyo is approaching, please share with people that would benefit: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Travel_Support_Program
  *   OpenStack Seattle Day is offering free passes to women and minorities, please apply/share: http://www.openstackseattle.com/diversity-scholarships/
  *   OpenStack Tokyo Summit visa information: http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/get-your-openstack-summit-tokyo-visa-in-five-steps

We have also started 3 different projects:

  *   Diversity Survey project: we will be sending out a survey to gather more information from OpenStack community.
  *   Diversity Data project: we need to determine what data we already have and what success would look like.
  *   Code of conduct review project: reviewing current code of conduct and process for reporting/resolving violations.

We have volunteers for each project and expect more following next week's meeting.
If you want to help, or have any questions/comments please let me know.
Thank you,
Egle

Thanks for leading the next meeting Amy!

I'm confused about part of the agenda though. Both the Diversity Data
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOFBdXOGsIjtxYLwKqjKUDkGPN2C7zHKzxUjEGq5m58/edit>
and Diversity Survey
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/139FLmZ32ydWMwvejiAQ1ZuOBl6dtVpIXyCNDZ69IFPQ/edit>
teams
are underway. The core groups were started Meeting 5 (Aug 6th) and both
teams are working towards their goals w/ actions items that have an Aug 27
due date. Shouldn't this be an update from them?

Also there's no mention of the Code of Conduct
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MtWnboev18kpOXBz37NCv972uzPCwbr8Toby7VaqxzI/edit>
sub-committee, can we have their update added to the agenda as well?

Thanks,
Amanda

Women of OpenStack - There is a desire to create regular, on-going opportunities for Collaboration across this group. This will enable us to continue the dialog and interaction we have at the Summits and expand the scope of our activities.

One area for expansion is to collaborate with the Diversity Work Group to both inform the definition of programs that increase the participation and contributions of Women into OpenStack as well as lead execution of these programs.

We'd like to invite you to join for a kick-off meeting to discuss:
*       Diversity WG Collaboration
*       Goals & Objectives for regular WOO meetings
*       Logistics planning for the regular meetings

The Doodle at the link below, is for the kick-off meeting scheduling. Pls indicate which days/times between 9/1-9/4 work for your calendar. The Doodle will close on Thursday and we will publish the meeting time.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Command Presence Workshop at Tokyo Summit
Message-ID: <766F7314-832C-4FDD-BDB4-D2A69A52841F@openstack.org>

Hi everyone,

On the Monday before the OpenStack Summit Tokyo begins, the Women of OpenStack would like to invite you to the Command?Presence Workshop <http://openstacksummitoctober2015tokyo.sched.org/event/1ddf6338bc6c5e9fec181663ea1fa47b#.VeSPktNViko>. This event is intended to teach participants how to handle ?senior-level high pressure meetings,? and the majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event. If you are a technical woman who regularly attends technical meetings working groups and would like to develop and ?command your presence? in high pressure meetings, then this event is for you!

Please note that this event occurs before the launch of the Summit, so please plan your travel accordingly. 

This event is on Monday, October 26 from 9:30am to 12:30pm in the Ougyoku room in the Summit venue, and additional event information will be shared with attendees who RSVP. 

Space is limited, so RSVPs are required. RSVP HERE <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fj7V0nLh7UBvj7I7htWLz63ygdk4vRDkU2DqB-t1TQo/edit?usp=sharing>

See you in Tokyo! 

Cheers,
Kendall

Re this:



Women of OpenStack

September 2, 2015

18:00 UTC



We will use a voice line for this call:

 Access: (888) 875-9370, Bridge: 3; Passcode: 1278598



"I understand the foundation has sponsored a female diversity intern that
probably cant dial this US freecall number. What number should she call?"



"As with all OpenStack meetings, we must provide equal access to all
foundation members, even those outside the US".



Cheers

Tristan
