Hi all --

Does anyone have women in their networks who would like to talk about IOT
applications in the Cloud Apps track at the Summit? I'm one of the track
chairs and we're all seeking diversity on panels. Get in touch with me in
the next day or so, please! Use my annegentle at justwriteclick dot com
email address to get in touch.

Thanks!
Anne

Thanks everyone who responded, I'll get back with what we're doing to

Much appreciation, you all are a gift.

Hi

I am a female OpenStack contributor from Pakistan. I recieved my OpenStack
summit invitation with a Free Full Access Pass. Is there any grant to help
me with the travel support ? As I won't be able to attend the Summit
otherwise. Or is it possible to apply for any other kind of funding under
the Women of OpenStack that might help me out.

Thank you

P.S I have attached the free access pass email below

Dear Aqsa,

We hope you will be able to join us in Austin for the next OpenStack
Summit, April 25-29. The main conference will run Monday through
Thursday, the Ops Summit will run on Monday, and the Design Summit
will run Tuesday through Friday. View this image for reference:

    https://www.dropbox.com/s/pj262nrpxs07v96/schedule-chart.jpg?dl=0

We're providing all ATCs who contributed to the Mitaka cycle with a
$600-off discount code to register for a Full Access Pass to the
Summit; this means that all ATCs will be able to register for FREE
if you use the code to register BEFORE March 11 at midnight PST,
when registration prices will increase. If you use the ATC code to
register after March 11 a fee will be charged.

REGISTER - Registration is now open at:

Yes, there is a travel support program:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Travel_Support_Program

However, the deadline to apply was Feb. 29th.

Please be aware and try again next time! We specifically want women to be
aware of the program. Also, reaching out on this list is the right thing to
do. Perhaps someone from the Foundation knows of the current status.

Thanks,
Anne

Hi Aqsa and welcome,

The link for the travel support program is: https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/austin-and-travel/#travel-support

I did see it had a deadline of February 9th though. Someone from the Foundation on this list might have more information if anything changed.

I came to know of this travel support program when I got the pass, and that
was on March 4th. So nothing could've been done by, thats why I reached out
to WOO for any possible help.

Hi there,

Unfortunately it?s too late for the Austin summit. The deadline for the TSP has passed, the selection committee has finished their selections, the accepted people have been notified and all of the available hotel rooms have been filled. I?m sorry.

For the Barcelona Summit the TSP will open in May and the submission deadline will be the first week of August. We will email everyone when it goes live.

Best,
Claire

Hi Aqsa,

I'd encourage you to improve your chances in the next round for the
Barcelona Summit by getting involved in a local user group and landing more
patches. That way, your chances for getting travel support are increased
and you can learn more about the OpenStack community.

Anne

OpenStack Summit Austin, April 24-29th

SUNDAY
Command Presence Workshop
9:30am-12:30pm
JW Marriott- Salon D
The Command Presence Workshop has been recognized by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review. It is intended to teach participants how to handle ?senior-level high pressure meetings?. The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event. In the class, each participant assumes a role, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slides. Once the class has prepared, the simulation begins. There is a role-play simulation. It is not uncommon to hear occasional ?gasps? of disbelief from the participants. The workshop participants will experience rapid-fire questioning, interruption, and other situations that occur in senior-level meetings, but in a safe environment conducive to learning techniques for handling such situations. Facilitators: Ruchi Bhargava (Intel), Malini Bhandaru (Intel) and a panel of leaders representative of the OpenStack leadership in the community (business leaders and technical leaders).

The Friendly Faces meet-up was combined for time/space considerations, should we make a separate blurb and RSVP for it? It?s pretty informal but it?s a good way for new people to get involved.

Speed Mentoring

ACC, Level 1, Expo Hall 5
The new mentoring program sponsored the Women of OpenStack is designed to be a lightweight mentoring initiative to provide technical or career guidance to beginners in the community. Mentees should already be part of the community; they should have gone through, or be familiar with the Upstream Training. Mentees will have five-to-10 minutes to talk to potential mentors, then cycle throughout the room for about an hour-and-a-half. At the end, people will fill out surveys with their preferences and we'll contact people about potential matches. Breakfast and coffee will be provided. More information coming soon.

and want to make sure that the people on the panel will attend this
workshop.  Suzy, Tamara and Shilla - please make sure your representatives

will also work with Brad to see if there is any other prep call we want to
do for the panel.

> The Command Presence Workshop has been recognized by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review. It is intended to teach participants how to handle ?senior-level high pressure meetings?. The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event. In the class, each participant assumes a role, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slides. Once the class has prepared, the simulation begins. There is a role-play simulation. It is not uncommon to hear occasional ?gasps? of disbelief from the participants. The workshop participants will experience rapid-fire questioning, interruption, and other situations that occur in senior-level meetings, but in a safe environment conducive to learning techniques for handling such situations. Facilitators: Ruchi Bhargava (Intel), Malini Bhandaru (Intel) and a panel of leaders representative of the OpenStack leadership in the community (business leaders and technical leaders).

We ended up in another hotel so I'm going to be canceling the room I have at the Marriot Courtyard, I believe it's currently #10 on the map. I don't think the hotel is booked yet but if someone needs it I'd rather it go to someone in our group. The reservation is for 4/24-4/29.

Just let me know by Monday.

Hi all,

also my first OpenStack Summit so far, I'm totally excited to get involved in the Community! I'm a little bit worried too, because I'm not coming directly from IT but I hope we will handle that :)

Looking forward to meet you!

We ended up in another hotel so I'm going to be canceling the room I have at the Marriot Courtyard, I believe it's currently #10 on the map. I don't think the hotel is booked yet but if someone needs it I'd rather it go to someone in our group. The reservation is for 4/24-4/29.

Just let me know by Monday.

Thanks,

Amy

Get ready to meet some of the best people on the planet. The Tokyo Summit
was my second, but this community helped me tremendously to actually feel
like a part of things. It was a much better experience, for me, than my
first one in Paris.

Best,

Ash

Message-ID: <D31F080F.1A96F%amy.marrich@rackspace.com>

Hey all,

This is the list I said I'd put together.

Amy


Places to see - car required or maybe a tour?

Fredricksburg, TX - lots of wineries, cute Main Street and it may be peach season!

Luchenbach, TX - really just a dance hall and a shop but world famous

Gruene - Historic District in New Braunfels, home of the oldest Dance Hall

San Antonio Riverwalk


Events:

New Braunfers Crawfish Festival - 4/29-30


BBQ:

Lockhart is the heart of TX BBQ - 4 historic places, I recommend Black's

The Salt Lick - historic cash only in Driftwood, plan on a 2+ hour wait on a weekend. I like Black's better:)


Things to do:

Tours of Hill Country Wineries

Lady Bird Lake - uberable

Botanical Garden in Austin - uberable

State House - walkable

Natural Bridge Caverns - New Braunfels need car

Schlitterbahn Water Park - Open on the weekends only, New Braunfels need car

Tubing! - Several options here the Comal and Guadalupe are both in New Braunfels



And some more official things to do

	matches has been made

Hi,
I just wanted to send out a celebratory email because we've done our first
set of matches for the mentoring program.  We matched 33 mentors and
mentees (so 66 people).  Thank you so much to everyone who signed up!  We
still have more matches to make.  We also have people signed up but waiting
to make their match at our Speed Mentoring event at the Austin summit.
This has been so much more successful than we ever imagined!

Special thanks to:
Danielle Lynch and Carol Barrett for their help making matches, sending
emails and planning the program
Mike Perez, Erin Disney, and Claire Massey from the Foundation for all
their help and support and feedback on the program
Marton Kiss who helped us coordinate between the mentoring program and
Upstream University

Sincerely,
Emily Kate Hugenbruch
