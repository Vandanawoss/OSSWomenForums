Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Auston Summit Panel ideas
Message-ID: <5689D9CC.4050707@luthcomputer.com>

Folks -
The Austin Summit is coming up and it is time to put together a WOS 
panel.  I am looking for some ideas.  So far I thought of doing a panel 
on how to achieve full parity.  Will post my thoughts, but I am looking 
for other ideas and volunteers for the panel.  Send me an email 
privately at bfcohen at luthcomputer.com to be added to the panel.

Hello Women of OpenStack community!
I was just reading an article to get inspiration for a talk proposal, and there was an interesting stat in there:
"Rapid growth of the OpenStack community means that many summit attendees are relative newcomers. At the previous two Summits, around 50-60 percent were first-time attendees."
Wow, I had no idea there were generally so many newcomers! ?I started thinking it would be cool if the Women of OpenStack could have something on their badges, like a sticker, or maybe a pin or something (flair!) that said "Ask me about Women of OpenStack!", so that we could all be ambassadors and welcome newbies into the group. I mean, granted, being women at an OpenStack summit might imply that we know a thing or two about Women of OpenStack. But, it might give us more of an identity (like a secret handshake, but an open, welcoming, friendly one :).?
I wanted to throw this out there and see what you thought.?
Happy New Year!
- Anne McCormick

We're not all women :)

I like the idea because it helps mark out those people who are happy to
be asked about such things from those who'd rather get on with being
attendees.

Will there be space on the badge? I remember them being fairly crowded
already, if anything I'd like people's IRC nicks to be larger. A "pin"
(badge to us British) or maybe one of those rubber bracelets would be
easier imo, also easier to take off if you want to be left alone for a
bit.

Please don't make it super pink, pink is a fine colour but let's not
follow that coding.

I definitely agree about the IRC nicks being bigger because most people
only know you by your nick. But there are plenty of folks who are
attending and aren?t on IRC so I can see why it?s not as prevalent on the
badge but they should be readable from a short distance.

A related question is does the Women of Openstack have a logo or even a
conference related logo? It?d be nice to utilize it in presentations as
we?re going to make the pamphlet of talks again.

I don't think we have a logo.  But it is a good idea to perhaps create one starting the Austin Summit.  Similar to how each project like Cinder etc. have an icon associated with it. 

On the original email suggesting some identification, the icon would help certainly. Some events like the Linux Con events, allow you to select various topics that you want showing on your badge.  So people know the topics you are interested in.  This could be where we could identify ourselves as part of WOOS and knowledgeable. 

I will add this to the agenda for Monday's WOOS meeting.

Hi everyone, 

I know that a Women of OpenStack logo has been discussed in previous meetings and events, so I wanted to loop in my colleague, Heidi Joy, who I am sure some of you have met at the Tokyo Summit or on other community calls. Among many things at the Foundation, Heidi Joy helps manage the logo use and requirements to make sure new logos are aligned with the OpenStack guidelines. I think that she will have a great insight on the best course of action.

There are a few brand guidelines <https://www.openstack.org/brand> that we should flag, including not adjusting/adapting the existing OpenStack logo (such as recoloring or reshaping it, and not taking the stacked O and using it as part of a new logo) that we have to enforce to support other global trademark concerns. While some projects have built their own logos, there?s not a lot of consistency and we don?t encourage them to protect the brand equity of the OpenStack logo.

I?d start by asking the larger question - why is a logo needed? Most projects and working groups don?t have them.

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] Women of OpenStack Flair


There are a few brand guidelines<https://www.openstack.org/brand> that we should flag, including not adjusting/adapting the existing OpenStack logo (such as recoloring or reshaping it, and not taking the stacked O and using it as part of a new logo) that we have to enforce to support other global trademark concerns. While some projects have built their own logos, there's not a lot of consistency and we don't encourage them to protect the brand equity of the OpenStack logo.

I'd start by asking the larger question - why is a logo needed? Most projects and working groups don't have them. It sounds like the key issue for WOO is to have a mark of distinction on a badge or on a participant, which could also be used in a pamphlet or presentation. In lieu of a logo contest, may I suggest that a few WOO folks work with the foundation design team to discuss how we can help identify members? We can discuss badge options, etc. Perhaps at the Monday meeting, 2 or 3 people could volunteer to guide that?

I'll be happy to answer any an all questions on logos & brand going forward! And I wholeheartedly support helping to identify WOO members. :-)

I don't think we have a logo.  But it is a good idea to perhaps create one starting the Austin Summit.  Similar to how each project like Cinder etc. have an icon associated with it.

On the original email suggesting some identification, the icon would help certainly. Some events like the Linux Con events, allow you to select various topics that you want showing on your badge.  So people know the topics you are interested in.  This could be where we could identify ourselves as part of WOOS and knowledgeable.

I will add this to the agenda for Monday's WOOS meeting.

I definitely agree about the IRC nicks being bigger because most people only know you by your nick. But there are plenty of folks who are attending and aren?t on IRC so I can see why it?s not as prevalent on the badge but they should be readable from a short distance.

A related question is does the Women of Openstack have a logo or even a conference related logo? It?d be nice to utilize it in presentations as we?re going to make the pamphlet of talks again.

I mean, granted, being women at an OpenStack summit might imply that

us more of an identity (like a secret handshake, but an open,

We're not all women :)

I like the idea because it helps mark out those people who are happy to
be asked about such things from those who'd rather get on with being
attendees.

Will there be space on the badge? I remember them being fairly crowded
already, if anything I'd like people's IRC nicks to be larger. A "pin"
(badge to us British) or maybe one of those rubber bracelets would be
easier imo, also easier to take off if you want to be left alone for a
bit.

Please don't make it super pink, pink is a fine colour but let's not
follow that coding.

For discussions, could you just set up a regular mailing list?  The
advantages over linked-in for open source are: open platform, indexed
by the search engines and easy subscriptions.  If you want an existing
one with a reasonable email interface and social attachments, google
groups is OK.

	Girl" looking for programming mentors
Message-ID: <CALOmtcUMb4zPJ4_nfJwW+ypA8oqtC367S0cPu5952N7E0XD1Yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

"Learn IT, Girl" is a mentoring program born as a Google Anita Borg
outreach project in 2014 for helping girls and female learn a new
programming language while working on a project of their choice for 3
months from February to April. Last year the program had an incredible
success, with 118 pairs of mentors and mentees accepted, learning 10
different languages.

This year we have worked hard on a web platform that will allow us to
handle an even bigger number of participants. We are getting an incredible
number of mentee applications already. These are women willing to work on a
project in a new programming language, both newbies and programmers who
want to expand their knowledge. However, we will be limited by the number
of mentor applications we receive when accepting these mentees into the
program. This is why, if you  have some programming experience and a
little bit of time, we want to invite you to apply as a mentor at
www.learnitgirl.com. The time commitment can be from 3 hours a week and the
impact on both the mentee and yourself will be enormous.

Of course, if you want to learn a new language with the help of a mentor,
you are more than welcome to apply as a mentee.

Applications will be open until January 18.

If you don't have time to be a mentor, you can still join our Facebook
group at https://www.facebook.com/groups/learnitgirl/ and support mentees
through the program by helping solve specific doubts.

If you have any doubts, feel free to ask me or send an email to
learnitgirl.office at gmail.com

Tapasweni Pathak

Next week the meeting will be January 28th at 18:00 UTC (12:00 PM CST).  Our wiki page has agenda and etherpad info: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Diversity

Some of you might have outdated calendar invite from Carol Barrett for tomorrow, Thursday 18:00 UTC. Instead, the meeting has moved to 05:00 UTC, I had sent out an updated invite.

If you are able, join tonights/today's APAC time zone friendly meeting. Kavit Munshi from Aptira will be leading it.

Let me know if you have any questions!
Thank you,

Hi Egle,

I will try to join the calls going forward. I attended the meeting in Tokyo and chimed in during the discussion of tooling, e.g. on "getting git/gerrit to work on Windows".  I started writing a basic guide at the time, since I had worked though this a couple of times and found it to be pretty mysterious, and didn't want to have to relearn it each time I set it up.
https://wiki.opnfv.org/developer/getting_started/windows
Note we are moving to a new wiki platform (Confluence) in OPNFV, so this link may change.
The goal for this wiki page is to be a guide that evolves as new needs/quirks are discovered/resolved etc. Confluence provides a comment tool enabling that.

Also note that in addition to the calendar invite for 5 UTC (last night), I received a invite for a meeting today at 18:00 UTC.

Thanks,
Bryan Sullivan | AT&T

Hello everyone,

I'm proposing talk related to new Oslo lib called OSprofiler
<https://github.com/openstack/osprofiler>, and I wonder if I need to
set *#Women
of OpenStack* tag in the *Speaker* section. I never was too active in this
group (although I believe it's a right time to do that :D), so I try to
understand is it ok for me to use it :)

Cheers,
Dina

Folks -
I am still looking for a man to be on the WOS panel.  Needs to have an interest in supporting women and minorities on the OS community.  Please send me his name and information so I can add him to the panel before it closes.

Hello everyone,

I'm proposing talk related to new Oslo lib called OSprofiler <https://github.com/openstack/osprofiler>, and I wonder if I need to set *#Women of OpenStack* tag in the *Speaker* section. I never was too active in this group (although I believe it's a right time to do that :D), so I try to understand is it ok for me to use it :)

Cheers,
Dina

Sadly I will have to miss it as I will be traveling during the meeting.  I do not have anything to report other than I have not found a man for our panel submission yet.  Please ask your friends who would like to join the panel and I will be happy to add them.

Hi Beth,
One or two of my male co-workers would be interested in joining the panel. Could you please give me more details about the panel discussion so I can inform them?

Thanks,
Padma

Folks -
Here is more about the panel:

Following up on the themes related to gender equality presented at the 
previous Summit talks sponsored by The Women of OpenStack working group, 
this session will focus on our vision of a world where the OpenStack 
community is truly and completely blind to meaningless differences in 
gender, color, creed and culture. What will this new world look like? 
How will it differ from the current one?

A panel of people from all walks of life will explore what that future 
is and what we can do as a community as a whole to achieve it.

I am looking for a man who is supportive of the OpenStack culture of 
inclusivity and can represent the man's perspective of how we will reach 
full equality.

Beth
