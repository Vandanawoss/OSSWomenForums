	Outreachy (former OPW)]
Message-ID: <1425412925.9415.116.camel@sputacchio.gateway.2wire.net>

Attached find the call for mentors to women interested in contributing
to OpenStack (URL for easy twitter sharing
http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-March/058148.html). 

Please help us spread the word :)

Outreachy also is looking for more funding (the program changed name
from Outreach Program for Women). At the moment the only secured funding
is provided by OpenStack Foundation for two interns (US$6,500 each) for
the May-August 2015 cycle. 

If you have funding in your organization to sponsor internships,
Outreachy runs twice a year, it costs $6,500 per intern. More details on
https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/Admin/InfoForOrgs

Regards,
Stef

Hi all,

Next round application deadline for Outreachy is close and and we need mentors willing to help newcomers to get involved with OpenStack and help them start contributing [0][1].

This would be the 5th time OpenStack joins Outreachy and for now we can say we are having a great outcome for this: we got many new strong contributors, we had several interesting new features and we are helping many women to start their careers in FOSS.

The mentor task is not very time consuming and its a really good experience. Please, if you are interested, feel free to contact me and I'll give you further details.

Thanks a lot,

Hi there,

If you?re planning to attend the May Summit in Vancouver then we highly encourage you to submit for a session for the #vBrownBag Tech Talks.

The Tech Talks are brief 10-minute talks presented to a very small audience (less than 20 people). The talks are livestreamed, video recorded and posted online within 24 hours. This is a great way to ease into presenting if you?re not yet comfortable with public speaking. :)

We?ve dedicated all of the Tuesday slots for the Women of OpenStack! View details and submit here: http://openstack.prov12n.com/vbrownbag-techtalks-in-vancouver/ <http://openstack.prov12n.com/vbrownbag-techtalks-in-vancouver/>

More info on other Summit related WOO events will be shared soon. There?s a lot happening this time so stay tuned!

Cheers,
Claire
