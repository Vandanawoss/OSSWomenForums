Re this:

Women of OpenStack
September 2, 2015
18:00 UTC

We will use a voice line for this call:
 Access: (888) 875-9370, Bridge: 3; Passcode: 1278598

"I understand the foundation has sponsored a female diversity intern that probably cant dial this US freecall number. What number should she call?"

"As with all OpenStack meetings, we must provide equal access to all foundation members, even those outside the US".

Cheers
Tristan

Thanks for your responses in the Doodle. Based upon that, we will have our kick-off meeting on Wednesday  9/2/15 at 18:00 UTC.

You can find the agenda and logistics here: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/9_2_15_WOS

Talk with you then!

The team that has put together the kick-off meeting decided on a voice call as being a more approachable vehicle than IRC.

People who are new to IRC, Gerrit, etc. can find those tools difficult to configure and run, and by using IRC we could make it more challenging for people to participate.

Thanks
Carol

Or alternatively, how about falling back to the standard medium that's been
effectively mandated[1] for project team meetings upstream, i.e. public
logged IRC?

I realize the number provided on etherpad is toll free. But I would need an
access code for India.

Also, a little introduction: I'm Mahati. I currently work for Intel,
contributing to OpenStack-Swift. I was previously an intern of Outreachy
program (Dec 2014 - Mar 2015) and worked on a feature development in Swift.

Thanks!
Mahati

Ideally anywhere that might have an OpenStack community. I know we have
active communities in:

- Australia
- NZ
- India,
- China (incl HK)
- Taiwan
- Japan
- Vietnam
- Singapore
- Vietnam
- South Africa
- Kenya
- Some of the Gulf States

The countries where a user group exists would be a good guide. I expect
most conf-call providers to have widespread toll-free access, although a
provider with toll-free coverage in some of the developing nations might be
harder.

Hi Carol,

I'm interested in attending this meeting. This would be my first - I have
been following the mails but haven't had the time to participate so far.

Could you let me know of a toll free number if there is any? I would be
joining in from Bangalore, India.

Thanks!
Mahati

Doh. I missed the meeting. Totally my fault. I converted to Central time, but put it in my calendar while my calendar was set to Pacific. Time conversion obviously not my strong suit.

I had an idea I wanted to share. In the case of diversity and women in tech, we?ve had events/breakfasts/activities for those groups.  While the events are fun (I LOVED the boat cruise), it doesn?t do much to bring the group back into the fold of the community.

What if we did a Twitter campaign associated with a hashtag similar to the #ilooklikeanengineer campaign that ran a while back?

We could do something I like #isupportopenstackwomen or #isupportopenstackdiversity (or some other hashtag that is potentially shorter) and use them throughout the Tokyo event (and potentially beyond). We might also be able to get some folks in the community to kick things off with tweets followed by the hashtag and have a photo booth area with signs/props for photos/sharing. Maybe a chalkboard that folks can write on or a whiteboard sign with the hashtag. We could also have them in different languages representing other countries.

Sample tweets would answer ?Why do you support diversity in OpenStack?? or ?Why do you support Women of OpenStack?"

Because my daughter deserves to succeed  #isupportOSwomen
Because OpenStack is better for it #isupportOSdiversity
Because vanilla is boring ##isupportOSdiversity
Because our users are diverse #isupportOSdiversity
Because the women?s bathroom can be lonely #isupportOSwomen
Because the glass ceiling deserves to be broken #isupportOSwomen
Because diversity = innovation #isupportOSdiversity

Or alternatively, how about falling back to the standard medium that's been
effectively mandated[1] for project team meetings upstream, i.e. public
logged IRC?

Jeremy - Sorry you couldn't join. This came up in the meeting today. And not only about IRC but also Etherpads and Gerrit.

Here's the etherpad from today's discussion: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/9_2_15_WOS and action items with owners. Feel free to add your comments and name to any of the action items.
Thanks
Carol

Though it does appear that requiring the use of a telephone did indeed make it difficult/impossible for at least some people to participate. Perhaps having a conference call to explain to people how to use IRC would be a good middle ground, and faster bootstrap participants onto the mechanisms established within our community for mass communication.

Hi Niki - I love the idea of a social media/ hashtag campaign to promote
awareness.

The only suggestion I have is to propose we make it more inclusive of
broader groups in the OpenStack community.

For example:  #iamopenstack

Would like to her other comments as well...

  Or alternatively, how about falling back to the standard medium that's
  been
  effectively mandated[1] for project team meetings upstream, i.e. public
  logged IRC?

I like that, similar to #ilooklikeanengineer, this normalises diversity
more than it highlights. It's concise too.

I wouldn't use "OS" in any hashtag, Anne Gentle posted on the mailing
list about not using OS to mean OpenStack a while back.

Great idea Niki!

This!

Access should be equitable from everywhere.

Anything else is exclusionary.

Hi Jeremy,

There are pretty good instructions for using IRC on the OpenStack Wiki
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC and Freenode site
https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml.
And a tutorial here: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html

If you have questions that aren't covered there, please let me know.  I'm
happy to do an IRC walk through, if needed.

Courtney

Agreed, those are great.

I was actually suggesting an IRC tutorial might be helpful for
people who would rather have conference calls because they're
disinclined to learn how to conduct meetings the way the rest of
OpenStack does. If you've already determined to switch to IRC
meetings then it sounds like it wasn't a substantial hurdle after
all.

See http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/ for instructions on adding your
regular meetings to the schedule, and
http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/irc.html#starting-a-meeting
for some helpful hints on how to interact with our meetbot to take
advantage of logging and autogenerated meeting minutes. Don't
hesitate to let me or others in the Project Infrastructure team know
if you have any questions or need further assistance!

Hi Jeremy,

Using a phone/VoIP call was not because the group "would rather have
conference calls because they're
disinclined to learn how to conduct meetings the way the rest of OpenStack
does".  For one OpenStack conducts meetings in many ways including IRC,
face-to-face, over Etherpad and using voice/VoIP calls.

In particular using the phrases "disinclined to learn" and "it wasn't a
substantial hurdle after
all." comes across poorly. One of the points of this group is to identify
what are the barriers women face and how can we help. Women brought up
concerns about IRC as being a barrier from a technical and group
interaction standpoint. We are evaluating the best options to address those
concerns.

As a starting point we had the meeting via phone call and Carol offered to
get access codes attendees in different countries. We discussed the
geography, time and technology questions. There are no easy answers so we
will have to try different things as we find ways to help women ramp up to
the OpenStack community and flourish. Just because a tool was adopted once,
doesn't mean that we shouldn't explore other options that might be a better
fit. To be clear that doesn't mean we are discarding the current tools
or impeding communication, indeed part of the conversation was devoted to
how to help people move past technical barriers to using the most popular
OpenStack tools (IRC, Gerrit etc).

We determined that one action to redress the technical barrier with IRC is
to have "tech office hours" during the lunches at the summit for those in
need of assistance. While I appreciate that there are
some instructions that you and Courtney provided/approved of, they are not
great for beginners and assume a great deal. Additionally for IRC to have
parity with other chatting clients or to be useful in the way we
(OpenStack) uses it requires 3+ additional systems be installed
or understood (bouncer/proxy, cloak, etherpad, eavesdrop etc). It's painful
to setup and use, creating a complexity that is often best handled with
in-person help. It would be great to have your and the other Project
Infrastructure team members experience and help getting interested
newbies ramped up and comfortable with the OpenStack tools.

The non-technical barriers are a different kind of concern and we will be
looking at defining them and, as mentioned, evaluating the best options to
address the concerns.

Thanks,
Amanda

For the most part, non-IRC meetings (aside from ~quarterly in-person
get-togethers at the Design Summit and some mid-cycle sprints) have
mostly catered to the business sector of our community. First and
foremost, OpenStack is a community around free and open software and
so its primary modes of communication are in plaintext (mailing
lists and IRC), a long-standing tradition evolved through decades of
trial and error within our predecessor communities who determined
that these were far and above the most broadly accessible and
consumable channels through which to interact.

> In particular using the phrases "disinclined to learn" and "it

My sincerest apologies, I simply wanted to underscore that the
biggest hurdle I've seen for newcomers is a fear of new tools. The
world of free software is culturally dissimilar to most
corporate/business settings and the tools and protocols its
inhabitants have adopted are by necessity not what outsiders may be
used to for other sorts of interaction. OpenStack is a little
unusual in that the number of new recruits from purely corporate
cultures is higher than for a typical free project, and so we have
to work even harder to introduce them to our seemingly alien tools,
expectations and ideals to avoid fragmentation and loss of communal
identity.

I'd be thrilled to work out ways we can make IRC and mailing lists
more welcoming and usable for everyone. I worry that a push to
alternative tools and communication channels will only serve to
alienate already marginalized groups within our community, further
dividing us.

Sure for day-to-day communication either a bouncer/proxy or some
dedicated connection for the machine where your IRC client is
running is helpful though not especially required. When it comes to
holding weekly meetings on the other hand, that's almost immaterial.

Cloaks are also not necessary (I don't use one for example) but are
also not software, you just need to request a "cloak" for your
account from the IRC network administrators if you want to maintain
some level of anonymity. To put this in perspective, we don't
anonymize the origins of messages to our mailing lists either, and
the information contained in the SMTP headers distributed to all
subscribers is equally as identifying of the message author (if not
more so).

It's not clear what you're implying with etherpad and eavesdrop, as
those are merely Web sites our community maintains. Etherpad is
(infrequently in my experience) used as a side-channel for
collaborative editing during some IRC meetings but more often simply
referred to just as any other Web page. Eavesdrop only comes into
play when you're referring someone to logs of a past meeting or of a
discussion which took place in some other logged channel, or to a
copy of the calendar for all our scheduled meetings, and is again
just a page with information on it. While these are of course added
conveniences, neither is integral to actually holding a meeting in
IRC.

Community and Project Infrastructure is led by a (always growing but
still) very small group of individuals and while we're happy to
provide pointers and assistance, the sort of one-on-one training
you're describing already exists:

    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStack_Upstream_Training

If not identical, it's close (perhaps a superset) of what it sounds
like you've envisioned. We should first see what can be done to
increase availability of that program and, if needed, vary the
content and timetable to suit your particular audience.

Exactly.

Thanks Jeremy for articulating that crucial aspect so clearly.

Hi Jeremy,

As I stated earlier "To be clear that doesn't mean we are discarding the
current tools or impeding communication, indeed part of the conversation
was devoted to how to help people move past technical barriers to using the
most popular OpenStack tools (IRC, Gerrit etc)."

We seem to be in agreement that more can and should be done to help with
tool adoption. We should build on that common goal of reducing the
technical friction. Increased visibility of the Upstream Training is a
great idea. I also think there could be updating of content around getting
set up with OpenStack tools that would greatly benefit everyone. While you
phrased it as "fear of new tools", most new people I've worked mainly
exhibit frustration and annoyance at how difficult setup is compared to
more modern options and do not enjoy the limitations of the system. Making
setup easier and educating them on the value of using an older system I
suspect would help lessen their dissatisfaction. I think our
two groups should partner on setting and delivering small, specific goals
that would benefit the community and in particular assist with the
on-boarding and retention of new OpenStack members -- particularly the ones
who are in the minority demographics.

We disagree that the Women of OpenStack group should clearly define the
other barriers with the tools, particularly IRC, and see what can be done
to remove them -- up to and including investigating other tools. If I
understand what you are saying, you see our attempt to identify and
ameliorate those pain points as absolutely leading to "a push to alternative
tools and communication channels will only serve to alienate already
marginalized groups within our community, further dividing us."

The women of OpenStack are part of the marginalized groups within the
community and this team is seeking ways to bridge those gaps not widen
them. There is no intent to push alternatives into the community. However
there is an interest in knowing what tools might better suit our diverse
needs and communication styles.  As you mentioned there is "a long-standing
tradition evolved through decades of trial and error" about the best tools.
It is very likely that the current tools will stand up to the scrutiny of
what works best, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't look at options,
examine what works and what could work better in order to ensure that we
are using the best tools and processes to be inclusive and welcoming to
minorities in order to move them from being marginalized to being
integrated.

I look forward to the great things our two groups can do together.

Thanks,

I read what you wrote, it just seems at odds with the choice to use
conference calls for a weekly meeting if the goal is to increase
interaction with the wider community (or at best, it's an ironic
situation).

> We seem to be in agreement that more can and should be done to

I've not really seen evidence that we have a problem with getting
the existing OpenStack community to adopt these tools (in fact they
already have), but rather that some new members have challenges
assimilating because these tools are foreign to them and, indeed,
probably foreign to anyone who hasn't been steeped in and
interacting with free software communities for years. A lack of
familiarity doesn't imply the tools are suboptimal, just that the
needs of this sort of community are better met by tools which may
not be popular in the mainstream because they don't meet the needs
of the average business or recreational computer user.

This is of course extremely subjective; what some see as limitation
others see as liberation. People are free to try to communicate with
the rest of the OpenStack community in any way they wish, but should
not be surprised that they have trouble integrating if they decide
to rely on communication mechanisms used only by a small subset...
they're trading one frustration for another.

> Making setup easier and educating them on the value of using an

It's probably a little misleading to paint these as "older systems"
(implying obsolescence). I would consider them "established, tried
and true, known-working" but again that's all a matter of
perception.

Absolutely, starting by identifying actionable problems is most
likely to gain traction. Vague "what's all this ugly old stuff, why
can't I just twitterface it to my OpenStack friendwall" sorts of
complaints may be easy to come by but ultimately won't lead anywhere
useful. There are some good pros/cons (specific to the meetings on
IRC discussion) listed in the meeting etherpad from Wednesday:

    https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/9_2_15_WOS

Unfortunately the only detail about the problem there is that IRC is
"less connected, interactive" and I don't even know what it's
supposed to mean (opinion perhaps? others happen to feel that IRC is
highly connected and extremely interactive). Specifics, please. This
is where a log of the meeting itself might have been more helpful.

This misses my concern, which has nothing to do with pushing
different modes of communication into the community. The community
is already communicating, but by choosing to not hold conversations
where the vast majority of OpenStack currently participate, those
subgroups silo themselves into islands or walled gardens and become
separate communities from OpenStack.

Experimentation is great, but integration comes through
participating with everyone else. I'm not worried that we've
made/will make poor choices as to what tools to use or abandon. I'm
worried that very important conversations, weekly meetings, are
occurring in isolation for reasons of convenience and so damaging
the integration of the groups they're trying to help. Inconvenience
is a price we all pay to be able to interact as a community of
thousands.

> I look forward to the great things our two groups can do together.

As do I. If you can assemble a short list of specific challenges
around our tools and/or documentation, we can get some solution
brainstorming going in an upcoming Infra meeting and hopefully come
away with a bit more direction:

WOS Members- The response to the Doodle was light! Based upon the responses, here are the proposed meeting times:
Monday at 1900 UTC (Noon Pacific)
Tuesday at 0200 UTC (Monday 7:00 PM Pacific)

There was a lot of comments on the ML on using Voice vs IRC for our meetings. I'm not sure whether the ML discussion reflects the preference for the people who are actively involved/or want to be actively involved  in this work group or not.  In order to be widely accessible, I'd like to propose that we start using IRC for our meetings (#openstack-meeting appears to be open at this time). If you want to propose a different approach, pls respond to the ML.

We had decided to meet bi-weekly and I will be sending out a meeting invitations for each of these meeting times.
Please come join and encourage others to as well!
Thanks
Carol

Hi Carol -
I for one am unable to attend to anything that is over IRC during work 
hourw as IRC is blocked on my company network.  Voice is SO much 
corporate friendly.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Call for mentors Outreachy Dec-March 2016
Message-ID: <55F8667F.5030902@redhat.com>

Hi everyone,

OpenStack will join next round of the Outreachy internships and we need 
you help: we are looking for full-time contributors willing to share 
some of their time, knowledge and experience to make our open-source 
organization more diverse and have the opportunity to meet new talents.

*_What is Outreachy_*
*
*
Outreachy helps people from groups underrepresented in free and open 
source software get involved. Read more in 
https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/ <https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/>.

OpenStack has been participating in this internships since Jan-Apr 2013, 
and we have had really good results: we got more full-time contributors, 
we got lots of good quality contributions, interns had the opportunity 
to give a great step in their professional careers and also it has been 
an enriching experience for everyone involved with the internship. More 
information about OpenStack participation in Outreachy can be find in 
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy 
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy>.

*Applications open next September 22nd, and the deadline for 
applications is October 27th. 
*https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/2015/DecemberMarch 
<https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/2015/DecemberMarch>

*_TLDR_*
*
*
Contributors interested on mentoring in Outreachy, please feel free to 
ask any question and ask for further directions here or in 
#openstack-opw in Freenode.

Try to find and propose a task for the next couple of months for your 
mentee. The task should be able to be finished on three months. Add this 
idea in this wiki https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Internship_ideas 
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Internship_ideas>.

Please join #openstack-opw as well, to welcome applicants and help them 
with their setups.

Another way to get in touch is through the internships mailing list, 
http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-internships <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-internships>.

*_Mentors_*
*
*
*Time requirements*
*
*
Being a mentor shouldn't take a lot of time from your working week. 
Mentors from previous rounds organized differently: you can schedule a 
weekly meeting to catch up with your mentee latest work, questions and 
next steps; some other prefer having a daily short meeting; you choose 
how to organize your agenda.

Consider that different mentees will need different guidance, but we aim 
to work with proactive and independent people. This qualities are 
defined during the application process, so make sure to participate 
actively in this so you make sure you get a mentee you can work with.

*Tasks*
*
*
Mentors are supposed to act as a channel for mentees with the rest of 
the community. You should be able to help them understand the community 
workflow (tools, milestones), introduce them to the team you are working 
with (so they also have other people to learn from), help them to gain 
confidence and participate of the weekly meetings.

You are not supposed to teach them the basics (say, we cannot have 
people that cannot program in Python), but you should be able to point 
them in the right direction with the tools we use in the community and 
they should be able to learn at their own pace.

*_Mentees_*
*
*
*Time requirements*
*
*
It is a full-time internship, so mentees are expected to work 40 hours 
per week in the assigned project.

*Tasks*
*
*
Mentees are supposed to devote their time on learning about the 
community, getting familiar with the tools used to contribute to 
OpenStack, understanding the basics of the code base of the project they 
are working on and finishing the assigned task before the internship 
ends. They are also encouraged to help with bug triaging, bug fixing and 
code reviewing. All this should be shared in a personal blog mentees 
have to set up when they start with their internships.

Thanks all,

Victoria

Linda - That sounds like a good alternative to IRC, providing the same replay capability. Would we be able to post links to the WebEx sessions from our Wiki page?

Beth - Thanks for that info. I wasn't aware that some companies blocked IRC. I had to jump through the Proxy hoops to make it work through Intel's firewalls.

Hi Carol,

Yes. The recording replay can be streamed or downloaded (.arf). Everyone will need to install the Cisco WebEx add-on (it's tiny & simple to install). Example below. If we grow to hundreds of participants :-), I might need to adjust the setup a bit.

Streaming recording link:

https://cisco.webex.com/ciscosales/ldr.php?RCID=9d0beb69e8d8c87a22c1e2375b2be6d7

Linda - That sounds like a good alternative to IRC, providing the same replay capability. Would we be able to post links to the WebEx sessions from our Wiki page?

I for one am unable to attend to anything that is over IRC during work hourw as IRC is blocked on my company network.  Voice is SO much corporate friendly.

Linda - Let's go with this plan for the meeting on the 21st.

Are the links below for attending the meeting or reviewing the recordings?  Can you send the info for people to attend the WebEx meeting? I'll add to the meeting invite, wiki and etherpad.
Thanks

Women of OpenStack:

You probably heard about Ahmed Mohamed, the Texas 9th grader and robotics enthusiast who brought a homemade clock to school hoping to impress teachers. Instead, he was arrested for a bomb hoax and interrogated without his parents.

I was compelled to help him, and got some encouragement from a few folks on Twitter to put together a scholarship fund campaign on GoFundMe. I just spoke with Ahmed's sister. She's young, along with being gracious and incredibly confident. Smart girl! We're now set up so donations go straight to them.

If you were moved by this story as I was, please consider donating and sharing this link with your social networks.

Hi Carol,

Yes. The recording replay can be streamed or downloaded (.arf). Everyone will need to install the Cisco WebEx add-on (it's tiny & simple to install). Example below. If we grow to hundreds of participants :-), I might need to adjust the setup a bit.

Streaming recording link:

As an IRC alternative, I'm happy to setup a multi-host recurring WebEx call with voice, chat, (optional) video and a recorded replay for folks who may not be available to attend, but want to listen to to call later.

Hi Carol -
I for one am unable to attend to anything that is over IRC during work hourw as IRC is blocked on my company network.  Voice is SO much corporate friendly.

WOS Members- The response to the Doodle was light! Based upon the responses, here are the proposed meeting times:
Monday at 1900 UTC (Noon Pacific)
Tuesday at 0200 UTC (Monday 7:00 PM Pacific)

There was a lot of comments on the ML on using Voice vs IRC for our meetings. I'm not sure whether the ML discussion reflects the preference for the people who are actively involved/or want to be actively involved  in this work group or not.  In order to be widely accessible, I'd like to propose that we start using IRC for our meetings (#openstack-meeting appears to be open at this time). If you want to propose a different approach, pls respond to the ML.

We had decided to meet bi-weekly and I will be sending out a meeting invitations for each of these meeting times.
Please come join and encourage others to as well!
Thanks
Carol

Hi Carol,

Yes. The recording replay can be streamed or downloaded (.arf). Everyone will need to install the Cisco WebEx add-on (it's tiny & simple to install). Example below. If we grow to hundreds of participants :-), I might need to adjust the setup a bit.

Linda ? That sounds like a good alternative to IRC, providing the same replay capability. Would we be able to post links to the WebEx sessions from our Wiki page?
Thanks

Hi Carol -
I for one am unable to attend to anything that is over IRC during work hourw as IRC is blocked on my company network.  Voice is SO much corporate friendly.

Message-ID: <56005A70.1090005@redhat.com>

Hi all,

I'm glad to announce that Mahati Chamarthy (mahatic) will join the 
current coordination efforts for the Outreachy internships. Thanks Mahati!

Also, I wanted to share this Etherpad [0] with you the current list of 
applicants and mentors for this round.

Applicants -> If you want to apply and don't see your name on this list, 
please add your name and the project/s you are interested on.

Mentors -> If you want to mentor someone and don't see your name on this 
list, please add your name and the project/s you are willing to mentor for.

Everyone else -> If you want to give us a hand and you don't know how, 
help us by spreading the word! Maybe a friend of yours want to join as 
an applicant or a coworker want to join as a mentor.

Every help is appreciated.

Cheers,

Victoria

Linda - Let's go with this plan for the meeting on the 21st.

Are the links below for attending the meeting or reviewing the recordings?  Can you send the info for people to attend the WebEx meeting? I'll add to the meeting invite, wiki and etherpad.
Thanks
Carol

As an IRC alternative, I'm happy to setup a multi-host recurring WebEx call with voice, chat, (optional) video and a recorded replay for folks who may not be available to attend, but want to listen to to call later.

Thanks,
Linda Skrocki

Hi Carol -
I for one am unable to attend to anything that is over IRC during work hourw as IRC is blocked on my company network.  Voice is SO much corporate friendly.

WOS Members- The response to the Doodle was light! Based upon the responses, here are the proposed meeting times:
Monday at 1900 UTC (Noon Pacific)
Tuesday at 0200 UTC (Monday 7:00 PM Pacific)

There was a lot of comments on the ML on using Voice vs IRC for our meetings. I'm not sure whether the ML discussion reflects the preference for the people who are actively involved/or want to be actively involved  in this work group or not.  In order to be widely accessible, I'd like to propose that we start using IRC for our meetings (#openstack-meeting appears to be open at this time). If you want to propose a different approach, pls respond to the ML.

We had decided to meet bi-weekly and I will be sending out a meeting invitations for each of these meeting times.
Please come join and encourage others to as well!
Thanks
Carol

Agenda:


Final review of the survey:
How long will the survey be available? One week?
When will we get the survey results back? Ideally 1-2 weeks ahead of the Summit, so we can integrate the data into content.


Messaging at Tokyo Summit:
Please review and edit this etherpad as appropriate: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Diversity_WG_Tokyo_Messaging
We have the opportunity to define some core messaging and call-to-action around Diversity and have it used in multiple forums (keynotes, sessions, work group meetings, etc). You can find a starting point at the link above, please help improve it!


Geo Diversity Update: What's the status of getting more geographic participation in this work group?

Team,

As we discussed on Monday, I am compiling a list of OpenStack Summit Tokyo Foundation sponsored sessions that include Women speakers.  While I am still building this list and need to adjust some links, formatting, and need to re-sort the list by session vs. speaker, here?s your BETA version of the list.  I?ll share my final results by COB Friday. Note that this list does not include WOS sponsored sessions (will add), Corporate sponsored talks, or vBrownBag TechTalks as that information is not yet available.

Emily ? Thanks for bringing this back up. I think it?s a great idea and would be interested in both getting tips on Gerrit/Github and could provide coaching o IRC and Etherpad.
It sounds like there will be multiple lunch areas across the Summit venues. I think we discussed having the WOS table be in a different venue each day to maximize the opportunities for people to stop by.
Claire/Allison:  Can you help us arrange this?

Thanks
Carol

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Tool lunch and learn at the summit?

Hi,
We ran out of time at yesterday's meeting to bring this up, so I wanted to run it past the listserv.

At the 9-2 meeting there was some interest in doing lunch and learn type sessions on different tools like IRC, Gerrit, Etherpad, Github, etc.  Mahati Chamarthy from Intel and I were talking about this and we'd be willing to lead them.  Is this still something the group is interested in?  We discussed a lot of summit ideas yesterday, did we not want to add anything else?

Thanks for feedback!

Sincerely,

Tamara - Thanks for creating this. I think it would be nice to have the Date, Time and Room for each of these in the table, to make it an easy to use reference that doesn't require clicking links (connectivity). What do you think?

Team,

As we discussed on Monday, I am compiling a list of OpenStack Summit Tokyo Foundation sponsored sessions that include Women speakers.  While I am still building this list and need to adjust some links, formatting, and need to re-sort the list by session vs. speaker, here's your BETA version of the list.  I'll share my final results by COB Friday. Note that this list does not include WOS sponsored sessions (will add), Corporate sponsored talks, or vBrownBag TechTalks as that information is not yet available.

Tamara -

Thank you for pulling this together! The sponsored sessions and #vBrownBag tech talks will be added to the schedule in a couple of weeks.

Once you have the list completed please send to me in a spreadsheet and I will make sure to send it to all of the women who are registered for the Summit - which will include several women who are not yet subscribed to this mailing list.

Cheers,
Claire

While I am still building this list and need to adjust some links, formatting, and need to re-sort the list by session vs. speaker, here?s your BETA version of the list.  I?ll share my final results by COB Friday. Note that this list does not include WOS sponsored sessions (will add), Corporate sponsored talks, or vBrownBag TechTalks as that information is not yet available.

Great idea! There's been on ongoing conversation/debate about using IRC and Etherpad for OpenStack meetings.

Subject: [Women-of-openstack] Tool lunch and learn at the summit?

Hi,
We ran out of time at yesterday's meeting to bring this up, so I wanted to run it past the listserv.

At the 9-2 meeting there was some interest in doing lunch and learn type sessions on different tools like IRC, Gerrit, Etherpad, Github, etc.  Mahati Chamarthy from Intel and I were talking about this and we'd be willing to lead them.  Is this still something the group is interested in?  We discussed a lot of summit ideas yesterday, did we not want to add anything else?

Thanks for feedback!

Hi all,

I?m happy to help arrange a lunch and learn tools session at the Summit. 

I?ve scheduled this during lunch on Wednesday in the breakout room that?s set classroom style - so that everyone has a table surface on which to place their lunch and laptops. I?ll have 40 boxed lunches delivered to the room.

Please send me the session description, session leaders name, email, title and bios and I will get it added to the schedule.

Cheers,
Claire

Emily,

I can put together some git cheat sheets for this if you like and probably make a sheet of gerrit instructions for setup.

Thanks,

It sounds like there will be multiple lunch areas across the Summit venues. I think we discussed having the WOS table be in a different venue each day to maximize the opportunities for people to stop by.

So wait- Is idea to do this at the summit? Or have virtually/over webexes in the non-summit rush?

Preferably, I think #2 is a better option. I know a lot of folks can't get to the Tokyo summit that would benefit from these session.

Thanks for the support Carol and Niki!
One thing we were thinking is that if we get a larger group, it might be hard to hear/see a screen, so we wondered if it would be better to have a separate room for this, with a projector.  I'm not sure how tight rooms are over lunch, though?
Thanks!

I?m happy to support either or both options. 

Hosting an in-person session at the Summit during lunch should avoid other conflicts. No other sessions are scheduled over lunch. :)

Just let me know what the group decides.

Cheers,
Claire

Sure.

And with all of them, record and have the ability to share for folks who couldn't make it, or show up on the mailing list asking "How do I use IRC, again!?"

As an FYI, I've attached the thread regarding the discussion about using IRC as a standardized way to be inclusive/consistent. (FYI- I don't necessarily have an opinion either way, just thought it was good for context.)

What if we split the difference and did some topics virtually and some in person?  So maybe schedule one virtually for before the summit, do another topic at the summit on Wednesday and then if there's enough interest, do a virtual replay of the Wednesday summit session sometime in November?

I'm happy to support either or both options.

Hosting an in-person session at the Summit during lunch should avoid other conflicts. No other sessions are scheduled over lunch. :)

Just let me know what the group decides.

Cheers,
Claire

Niki ? I think you raise a good point, we should provide virtual sessions for these topics so that people who won?t be in Tokyo can gain the info too.  We can dedicate a November meeting to covering these topics or we could schedule separate sessions for these to make sure we have time to provide an overview and answer questions and help on configuration issues (a big factor from my experience with Gerrit/Github).

I think we should have in-person sessions for the folks who will travel to Tokyo and take advantage of the Face to face opportunity.

Thanks
Carol

Hi,
We ran out of time at yesterday's meeting to bring this up, so I wanted to run it past the listserv.

At the 9-2 meeting there was some interest in doing lunch and learn type sessions on different tools like IRC, Gerrit, Etherpad, Github, etc.  Mahati Chamarthy from Intel and I were talking about this and we'd be willing to lead them.  Is this still something the group is interested in?  We discussed a lot of summit ideas yesterday, did we not want to add anything else?

Thanks for feedback!

We already have a few tables in the main hot buffet lunch room that will have table top signs that read, ?Reserved for the Women of OpenStack?. This idea was suggested on one of the previous WOO calls to create a dedicated place for women who are new to the summit to have a place to go each day to meet with each other. 

We can use one of those tables, or another one in the lunch room - but keep in mind it will be very noisy in there and not ideal at all for speaking with more than a handful of people.

Webex or GoToMeeting.  I'll be at the Summit, so I'm happy to use my laptop for the presentation, to run the projector and Webex.  I could probably scrounge up a decent microphone too, so the audio was ok, for the folks online.

Caveat: I'm making the assumption that the bandwidth at the summit will be sufficient.

The in-person ones can be shared virtually also, so people not at the summit can still join in.

What if we split the difference and did some topics virtually and some in person?  So maybe schedule one virtually for before the summit, do another topic at the summit on Wednesday and then if there's enough interest, do a virtual replay of the Wednesday summit session sometime in November?

I?m happy to support either or both options.

Hosting an in-person session at the Summit during lunch should avoid other conflicts. No other sessions are scheduled over lunch. :)

Just let me know what the group decides.

Cheers,
Claire

I can tell you from experience that unless you have a  dedicated access point, any kind of streaming on the conference wifi is next to impossible.

It?s a main reason why we paid for a dedicated connection for the podcast last year.

I?d say do the preso live at the summit, don?t record, and use post-summit opportunities to record and share.

Sorry, I joined in late.

This sounds good - if recording is a problem at the summit. But then again,
could we not have a recording setup like we generally would for other
sessions?

Thanks,

Hi All,

If you want a full on presentation with video record and an A/V Tech in the room - that is possible for the Wednesday lunch session, I just need to know now so I can plan for it.

Thanks!

Hi all,

Emily from IBM is ready to lead the virtual session for this and I for the
summit session.

I plan to cover git and gerrit at the summit. It'd be an introductory
hands-on session for submitting a patch, and cover a few more details
around them. Suggestions and ideas are welcome. If anyone else is
interested to hop in, contribute another topic and want to co-lead the
session, do let me know!

Thanks,
Mahati

Thanks Gals!

I?d probably go with the 14th for the webinar. The 21st is getting close to the summit and is likely to be busy for folks going or not.

Thanks Mahati.  I'll do a pre-summit session on methods of communication (IRC, Etherpad, listservs) in the community.  I'd like to do this sometime mid-October, maybe the 14th or 21st?  Is there a preferred method for hosting webinars?

Hi all,

Emily from IBM is ready to lead the virtual session for this and I for the summit session.

I plan to cover git and gerrit at the summit. It'd be an introductory hands-on session for submitting a patch, and cover a few more details around them. Suggestions and ideas are welcome. If anyone else is interested to hop in, contribute another topic and want to co-lead the session, do let me know!

Thanks,
Mahati

This sounds good - if recording is a problem at the summit. But then again, could we not have a recording setup like we generally would for other sessions?

Webex or GoToMeeting.  I'll be at the Summit, so I'm happy to use my laptop for the presentation, to run the projector and Webex.  I could probably scrounge up a decent microphone too, so the audio was ok, for the folks online.

Caveat: I'm making the assumption that the bandwidth at the summit will be sufficient.

The in-person ones can be shared virtually also, so people not at the summit can still join in.

What if we split the difference and did some topics virtually and some in person?  So maybe schedule one virtually for before the summit, do another topic at the summit on Wednesday and then if there's enough interest, do a virtual replay of the Wednesday summit session sometime in November?

Thanks!

Hosting an in-person session at the Summit during lunch should avoid other conflicts. No other sessions are scheduled over lunch. :)



Just let me know what the group decides.

Mahati,

While I was working on a cheat sheet we could hand out for git I found the one that github uses during training

https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf

It doesn?t have rebase and review which we use to get our code ready and to send it gerrit but it appears to have most everything else. We could provide this and then just the 8 steps or so to take people through creating the new branch through submit for review.

Let me know.

Thanks,

Amy

The in-person ones can be shared virtually also, so people not at the summit can still join in.

What if we split the difference and did some topics virtually and some in person?  So maybe schedule one virtually for before the summit, do another topic at the summit on Wednesday and then if there's enough interest, do a virtual replay of the Wednesday summit session sometime in November?
Thanks!

I?m happy to support either or both options.

Hosting an in-person session at the Summit during lunch should avoid other conflicts. No other sessions are scheduled over lunch. :)

Just let me know what the group decides.

Cheers,
Claire

Hello Amy,

Yup, that cheat sheet looks good enough. And we can walk them through the
ones that are required through git review.

Thanks!

Subject: [openstack-dev] [election] TC] TC Candidacy


I am writing to announce my candidacy a position on the TC.

I am not your typical candidate, which is one reason that I am asking for your vote. I have a technical background, with over a decade of software development experience. I have a marketing background, with over a decade of Technology, Product and Brand marketing experience. I have a business development background and have been an entrepreneur. I have been a product manager and a software planner. It's this combination of experiences that I have accumulated during my almost 35 years in the technology industry that I believe will enable me to provide unique value as a member of the TC.

I have been an active member in the community since 2013, working with Community teams to understand market-segment needs and/or barriers to their deployment of OpenStack and bringing that information to the Community in the form of specs, blueprints, prototypes and user stories (Win The Enterprise WG, Enterprise WG, Product WG). These teams have brought resources to develop these capabilities (one example is improving upgrade capabilities through versioned objects implementation) and have been able to close gaps resulting in expanding Enterprise deployments of OpenStack.

I believe that a diverse Community will enable us to develop more innovative software that will meet the needs of global markets. I work with both the Diversity Working Group and the Women of OpenStack to help strengthen the diversity of our Community.

As a TC member, I will work to support our success by utilizing my project/program management experience. Specifically, I will:
1)      Tap the collective market knowledge within our Community to identify innovative capabilities that will define the defacto cloud computing platform of the future.
2)      Work to bring projects together to define and implement cross-project capabilities and initiatives.
3)      Support the development of a multi-release roadmap definition and communication process.

As cross-project coordination needs expand and concepts like big tent stretch our capabilities, I believe that my skill-sets, experiences, and values align well with the emerging needs within our community.

I would appreciate the opportunity to further my contributions to our Community and thank you for your consideration.

Carol Barrett

Good going Carol.   As I do not spend too much time the groups, could you or someone else give me more specifics on how to support you.

Team - I want to let you know that I have decided to run for the TC. I think I can help the community be stronger and our software development more impactful.

If you're an ATC (ie. someone who can vote), I would appreciate your consideration.
Thanks
Carol

Subject: [openstack-dev] [election] TC] TC Candidacy


I am writing to announce my candidacy a position on the TC.

I am not your typical candidate, which is one reason that I am asking for your vote. I have a technical background, with over a decade of software development experience. I have a marketing background, with over a decade of Technology, Product and Brand marketing experience. I have a business development background and have been an entrepreneur. I have been a product manager and a software planner. It's this combination of experiences that I have accumulated during my almost 35 years in the technology industry that I believe will enable me to provide unique value as a member of the TC.

I have been an active member in the community since 2013, working with Community teams to understand market-segment needs and/or barriers to their deployment of OpenStack and bringing that information to the Community in the form of specs, blueprints, prototypes and user stories (Win The Enterprise WG, Enterprise WG, Product WG). These teams have brought resources to develop these capabilities (one example is improving upgrade capabilities through versioned objects implementation) and have been able to close gaps resulting in expanding Enterprise deployments of OpenStack.

I believe that a diverse Community will enable us to develop more innovative software that will meet the needs of global markets. I work with both the Diversity Working Group and the Women of OpenStack to help strengthen the diversity of our Community.

As a TC member, I will work to support our success by utilizing my project/program management experience. Specifically, I will:
1.      Tap the collective market knowledge within our Community to identify innovative capabilities that will define the defacto cloud computing platform of the future.
2.       Work to bring projects together to define and implement cross-project capabilities and initiatives.
3.       Support the development of a multi-release roadmap definition and communication process.

As cross-project coordination needs expand and concepts like big tent stretch our capabilities, I believe that my skill-sets, experiences, and values align well with the emerging needs within our community.

I would appreciate the opportunity to further my contributions to our Community and thank you for your consideration.

Carol Barrett
