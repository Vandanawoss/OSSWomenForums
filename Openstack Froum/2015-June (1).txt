Hey y'all

So I pretty much found out straight away that the "rules" for channels we manage on freenode should allow us to have a private channel as it's for a "diversity type" reason.

Technically I've found a person with admin rights who is willing to help set this up. I'm happy to help with any maintenance if there is any also. I think it should also be non-logged to add to it being a "safe-space" for us to just chat.

We will also need volunteers to write up some documentation with links to websites which are appropriate to 000 baby/completely non technical folk in order to help them get set up and running. A lot of the technology us techies take for granted is very very scary to non-technical people and we need to support all our colleagues not just the techies.

Currently I was told we needed to run this past the foundation and get it okayed before going ahead. I am not aware of who to speak to or how this needs to be approached. Can the organisers help with this please?

Cheers,

-grue-

Hi Susie,
Well... but the TC just passed a resolution to prevent private IRC
channels. [1] I'd like to see us agreeing to that guidance.

I was going to propose we use the existing open #openstack-opw channel,
which we use for the Outreach Program for Women, now named Outreachy. Since
-opw isn't the name of the program any more, we could rename the channel
#openstack-women.

I've talked to people who run channels with a requirement upon entry of
answering the question in the affirmative, "Do you agree to our terms (with
a link to the terms)?" If someone doesn't answer or hedges, then they are
kicked. If they still come back, but won't agree to the terms, they are
banned. Thing is, that turns into a trollbait channel and you have to have
24x7 coverage to ask and if you don't get the answer you need, to kick,
then ban the person who won't agree to the terms. I'm not sure we need that
level of filter.

My proposal would be to re-use the existing #openstack-opw channel,
renaming to #openstack-women (keeping with some other patterns in open
source [2]), and keeping it public. We should also decide if an agreement
upon entry is the way we want to go with this to help with the goal of
ensuring the channel remains open but with known goals for interaction.

What do you all think?
Thanks,
Anne

Hi all,

Renaming channels is not possible in Freenode, so the easiest way would be to create a new channel. #openstack-women sounds great, I have seen the same
approach in other open source communities -- I'm thinking about GNOME women.

Now, regarding adding privacy measures to it. I don't agree that we should make it private nor kick people out because they don't agree explicitly to the
code of conduct. That puts us in a defensive position and maybe makes things harder. I'd like to keep things open because OpenStack is an open source community.
Also, I think that adding different rules would just alienate us without need.
We should open #openstack-women as it were any other channel under the #openstack- umbrella,
create a code of conduct and, if someone breaks that code of conduct, then proceed to kick/ban them out.
If you please, I could ask for some feedback from the folks in the GNOME community.

I volunteer to do so.

Thanks,

Victoria

I?m in agreement with Anne.  I don?t know how much trolling happens on OpenStack channels, but I don?t think it?s a lot.  That said, there is a higher likelihood of trolling on a channel identifying itself as for women.  Maybe we should consider a little lower profile such as #openstack-woo.  Put info in the mailing list, the wikis, etc.

I would not like to limit the channel to just women.  If men are interested in our problems/solutions/discussions, they should be free to participate.  As long as they agree to and abide by the terms of participation.  I participated in the training session for women in tech dealing with trolling and other issues and it was heavily male, and extremely sympathetic and supportive of reducing the problems encountered by women in tech.  They can have valuable insight into defusing situations and supporting us in handling situations.

On the issue of keeping a record of the channel, I?m undecided.  I lean towards not recording the channel, but if someone has a good argument for it, I can easily be swayed.

My 2 cents.

I'll add one more voice for keeping it open.  Preemptively excluding anyone smacks too much of the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish.

Rocky's idea of using an acronym instead of -women is also pretty good, just to keep down trolls searching for a dating channel.  I know the name of the group has changed, but since the -opw already exists, how about we just use it to save the hassle?

Regarding logging, it looks to be required by the foundation.  "All OpenStack related channels shall be logged and made publicly accessible and attempts to notify channel users of that fact shall be undertaken."  http://governance.openstack.org/reference/irc.html

Susie mentioned needing documentation.  I wrote a good bit of the "how to use IRC" wiki page for my office, so I already have a lot of material.  I'd be glad to help.

+1 for keeping it as open and accessible as possible. I have said in the
past how a room full of women is no more diverse than a room full of men,
though I do understand the desire to have groups of all one gender or the
other in certain situations. Given the relatively few number of women in
tech and how we were not even 10% of the Vancouver summit population, we
need as many advocates as we can find to take up the cause of diversity of
thought through different genders and cultures. Making it as simple as
possibly to our male and female advocates and champions to find us and
interact with us seems like a great start.

As for trolling, I do worry about it, but also don't like making decisions
based on what might happen. Additional administrative overhead won't stop
the trolls and it adds extra work to the channel leaders. In fact, having
such a policy could actually attract more trolls. If they know there is an
open channel that makes you agree to something to stay, they might seek it
out for a cheap thrill knowing they can get a reaction easily.

#openstack-opw makes a lot of sense to keep it simple. We could also
consider -wos (*W*omen [of] *O*pen*S*tack, acryonymFinder
<http://www.acronymfinder.com/WOS.html>), but I do love -woo!

Merrian-Webster defines *woo* as "to try to attract (someone, such as a
customer, voter, worker, etc.) : to attempt to persuade (someone) to buy
something from you, vote for you, work for you, etc." Seems like part of
our goal might be to attract and persuade more women to join the community?

In the Clifton StrengthsFinder
<http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/721/woo.aspx>, "WOO" is an acronym
for "winning others over" and is all about getting to know people and
making sure strangers don't remain so for long. I think it is also very
fitting for Women of OpenStack.

(Disclaimer, WOO is in my top 10 strengths so I think it's just peachy!)

+1 to?

  *   Keeping it open and accessible to all
  *   Logging to align with the governance Courtney cites
  *   Not letting trolls dictate naming or anything else for that matter

I don't have a strong preference on the name.

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] IRC channel followup from working breakfast.

+1 for keeping it as open and accessible as possible. I have said in the past how a room full of women is no more diverse than a room full of men, though I do understand the desire to have groups of all one gender or the other in certain situations. Given the relatively few number of women in tech and how we were not even 10% of the Vancouver summit population, we need as many advocates as we can find to take up the cause of diversity of thought through different genders and cultures. Making it as simple as possibly to our male and female advocates and champions to find us and interact with us seems like a great start.

As for trolling, I do worry about it, but also don't like making decisions based on what might happen. Additional administrative overhead won't stop the trolls and it adds extra work to the channel leaders. In fact, having such a policy could actually attract more trolls. If they know there is an open channel that makes you agree to something to stay, they might seek it out for a cheap thrill knowing they can get a reaction easily.

#openstack-opw makes a lot of sense to keep it simple. We could also consider -wos (Women [of] OpenStack, acryonymFinder<http://www.acronymfinder.com/WOS.html>), but I do love -woo!

Merrian-Webster defines woo as "to try to attract (someone, such as a customer, voter, worker, etc.) : to attempt to persuade (someone) to buy something from you, vote for you, work for you, etc." Seems like part of our goal might be to attract and persuade more women to join the community?

In the Clifton StrengthsFinder<http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/721/woo.aspx>, "WOO" is an acronym for "winning others over" and is all about getting to know people and making sure strangers don't remain so for long. I think it is also very fitting for Women of OpenStack.

(Disclaimer, WOO is in my top 10 strengths so I think it's just peachy!)

Rocky's idea of using an acronym instead of ?women is also pretty good, just to keep down trolls searching for a dating channel.  I know the name of the group has changed, but since the ?opw already exists, how about we just use it to save the hassle?

Regarding logging, it looks to be required by the foundation.  "All OpenStack related channels shall be logged and made publicly accessible and attempts to notify channel users of that fact shall be undertaken."  http://governance.openstack.org/reference/irc.html

Susie mentioned needing documentation.  I wrote a good bit of the "how to use IRC" wiki page for my office, so I already have a lot of material.  I'd be glad to help.

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] IRC channel followup from working breakfast.

I?m in agreement with Anne.  I don?t know how much trolling happens on OpenStack channels, but I don?t think it?s a lot.  That said, there is a higher likelihood of trolling on a channel identifying itself as for women.  Maybe we should consider a little lower profile such as #openstack-woo.  Put info in the mailing list, the wikis, etc.

I would not like to limit the channel to just women.  If men are interested in our problems/solutions/discussions, they should be free to participate.  As long as they agree to and abide by the terms of participation.  I participated in the training session for women in tech dealing with trolling and other issues and it was heavily male, and extremely sympathetic and supportive of reducing the problems encountered by women in tech.  They can have valuable insight into defusing situations and supporting us in handling situations.

On the issue of keeping a record of the channel, I?m undecided.  I lean towards not recording the channel, but if someone has a good argument for it, I can easily be swayed.

My 2 cents.

Hey y'all

So I pretty much found out straight away that the "rules" for channels we manage on freenode should allow us to have a private channel as it's for a "diversity type" reason.

Hi Susie,
Well... but the TC just passed a resolution to prevent private IRC channels. [1] I'd like to see us agreeing to that guidance.

I was going to propose we use the existing open #openstack-opw channel, which we use for the Outreach Program for Women, now named Outreachy. Since -opw isn't the name of the program any more, we could rename the channel #openstack-women.

I've talked to people who run channels with a requirement upon entry of answering the question in the affirmative, "Do you agree to our terms (with a link to the terms)?" If someone doesn't answer or hedges, then they are kicked. If they still come back, but won't agree to the terms, they are banned. Thing is, that turns into a trollbait channel and you have to have 24x7 coverage to ask and if you don't get the answer you need, to kick, then ban the person who won't agree to the terms. I'm not sure we need that level of filter.

My proposal would be to re-use the existing #openstack-opw channel, renaming to #openstack-women (keeping with some other patterns in open source [2]), and keeping it public. We should also decide if an agreement upon entry is the way we want to go with this to help with the goal of ensuring the channel remains open but with known goals for interaction.

What do you all think?
Thanks,
Anne

	next steps
Message-ID: <OF483F5F5C.0EB666C3-ON87257E58.001E135C-86257E58.00233EBF@us.ibm.com>



Thanks for everyone who was able to join us at the Women of OpenStack
working session on May 19. A special thanks to our lightening talk
speakers: Valerie Aurora, Nina Goradia, and Madhura Maskasky for sharing
their experiences and inspiring our group discussions. If you have not
already seen the article, Allison Price from the OpenStack Foundation has
written a great summary of working session on Superuser:
http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/how-to-get-more-women-involved-in-tech-communication-leadership-and-mentors

After summarizing the group break out sessions there are very similar
themes to what we discussed during our Paris Summit working session. Key
areas of focus include:
1. Developing women leaders
2. Increasing the visibility of women in the OpenStack community
3. Mentorship
4. Building a strong communications channel for the Women of OpenStack

Several of you have asked, "What's next?" That is really up to us. We've
heard from many of you that you want the Women of OpenStack to continue to
work together between summits to address these key issues. To help
facilitate follow-on discussions I've included several volunteer sign up
sheets in addition to a full group summary in this google drive doc:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nu_0EperGdXIQifmjHiNVuB2RJb-5bVJkB9oRT-ExVw/edit#gid=0

The goal is for each volunteer group to come together as a team to develop
1-2 key actions they want to accomplish leading up to the Tokyo Summit.
There has already been some great progress and discussion on creating an
IRC channel which was one of our communication follow-up actions. I'm
looking forward to what this group can accomplish in the other areas as
well.

Let me know if you have any questions, I am definitely looking forward to
continuing the conversation ...

I just hoped into #openstack-opw.  There are 20 people logged on.  I guess it's still being used for outreach??

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] IRC channel followup from working breakfast.

+1 for keeping it as open and accessible as possible. I have said in the past how a room full of women is no more diverse than a room full of men, though I do understand the desire to have groups of all one gender or the other in certain situations. Given the relatively few number of women in tech and how we were not even 10% of the Vancouver summit population, we need as many advocates as we can find to take up the cause of diversity of thought through different genders and cultures. Making it as simple as possibly to our male and female advocates and champions to find us and interact with us seems like a great start.

As for trolling, I do worry about it, but also don't like making decisions based on what might happen. Additional administrative overhead won't stop the trolls and it adds extra work to the channel leaders. In fact, having such a policy could actually attract more trolls. If they know there is an open channel that makes you agree to something to stay, they might seek it out for a cheap thrill knowing they can get a reaction easily.

#openstack-opw makes a lot of sense to keep it simple. We could also consider -wos (Women [of] OpenStack, acryonymFinder<http://www.acronymfinder.com/WOS.html>), but I do love -woo!

Merrian-Webster defines woo as "to try to attract (someone, such as a customer, voter, worker, etc.) : to attempt to persuade (someone) to buy something from you, vote for you, work for you, etc." Seems like part of our goal might be to attract and persuade more women to join the community?

In the Clifton StrengthsFinder<http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/721/woo.aspx>, "WOO" is an acronym for "winning others over" and is all about getting to know people and making sure strangers don't remain so for long. I think it is also very fitting for Women of OpenStack.

(Disclaimer, WOO is in my top 10 strengths so I think it's just peachy!)

Rocky's idea of using an acronym instead of ?women is also pretty good, just to keep down trolls searching for a dating channel.  I know the name of the group has changed, but since the ?opw already exists, how about we just use it to save the hassle?

Regarding logging, it looks to be required by the foundation.  "All OpenStack related channels shall be logged and made publicly accessible and attempts to notify channel users of that fact shall be undertaken."  http://governance.openstack.org/reference/irc.html

Susie mentioned needing documentation.  I wrote a good bit of the "how to use IRC" wiki page for my office, so I already have a lot of material.  I'd be glad to help.

Subject: Re: [Women-of-openstack] IRC channel followup from working breakfast.

I?m in agreement with Anne.  I don?t know how much trolling happens on OpenStack channels, but I don?t think it?s a lot.  That said, there is a higher likelihood of trolling on a channel identifying itself as for women.  Maybe we should consider a little lower profile such as #openstack-woo.  Put info in the mailing list, the wikis, etc.

I would not like to limit the channel to just women.  If men are interested in our problems/solutions/discussions, they should be free to participate.  As long as they agree to and abide by the terms of participation.  I participated in the training session for women in tech dealing with trolling and other issues and it was heavily male, and extremely sympathetic and supportive of reducing the problems encountered by women in tech.  They can have valuable insight into defusing situations and supporting us in handling situations.

On the issue of keeping a record of the channel, I?m undecided.  I lean towards not recording the channel, but if someone has a good argument for it, I can easily be swayed.

My 2 cents.

Hey y'all

So I pretty much found out straight away that the "rules" for channels we manage on freenode should allow us to have a private channel as it's for a "diversity type" reason.

Hi Susie,
Well... but the TC just passed a resolution to prevent private IRC channels. [1] I'd like to see us agreeing to that guidance.

I was going to propose we use the existing open #openstack-opw channel, which we use for the Outreach Program for Women, now named Outreachy. Since -opw isn't the name of the program any more, we could rename the channel #openstack-women.

I've talked to people who run channels with a requirement upon entry of answering the question in the affirmative, "Do you agree to our terms (with a link to the terms)?" If someone doesn't answer or hedges, then they are kicked. If they still come back, but won't agree to the terms, they are banned. Thing is, that turns into a trollbait channel and you have to have 24x7 coverage to ask and if you don't get the answer you need, to kick, then ban the person who won't agree to the terms. I'm not sure we need that level of filter.

My proposal would be to re-use the existing #openstack-opw channel, renaming to #openstack-women (keeping with some other patterns in open source [2]), and keeping it public. We should also decide if an agreement upon entry is the way we want to go with this to help with the goal of ensuring the channel remains open but with known goals for interaction.

What do you all think?
Thanks,
Anne

Technically I've found a person with admin rights who is willing to help set this up. I'm happy to help with any maintenance if there is any also. I think it should also be non-logged to add to it being a "safe-space" for us to just chat.

We will also need volunteers to write up some documentation with links to websites which are appropriate to 000 baby/completely non technical folk in order to help them get set up and running. A lot of the technology us techies take for granted is very very scary to non-technical people and we need to support all our colleagues not just the techies.

Currently I was told we needed to run this past the foundation and get it okayed before going ahead. I am not aware of who to speak to or how this needs to be approached. Can the organisers help with this please?

Cheers,

-grue-

#openstack-women is a great name. Anything with woo is not so great.

I'm looking forward to the channel!

+1 to keeping it open to all and not letting trolls dictate anything. #openstack-women is a great name. Anything with woo is not so great. 

I'm looking forward to the channel!

+1 for keeping it as open and accessible as possible. I have said in the past how a room full of women is no more diverse than a room full of men, though I do understand the desire to have groups of all one gender or the other in certain situations. Given the relatively few number of women in tech and how we were not even 10% of the Vancouver summit population, we need as many advocates as we can find to take up the cause of diversity of thought through different genders and cultures. Making it as simple as possibly to our male and female advocates and champions to find us and interact with us seems like a great start. 

As for trolling, I do worry about it, but also don't like making decisions based on what might happen. Additional administrative overhead won't stop the trolls and it adds extra work to the channel leaders. In fact, having such a policy could actually attract more trolls. If they know there is an open channel that makes you agree to something to stay, they might seek it out for a cheap thrill knowing they can get a reaction easily. 

#openstack-opw makes a lot of sense to keep it simple. We could also consider -wos ( W omen [of] O pen S tack, acryonymFinder ), but I do love -woo! 

Merrian-Webster defines woo as "to try to attract (someone, such as a customer, voter, worker, etc.) : to attempt to persuade (someone) to buy something from you, vote for you, work for you, etc." Seems like part of our goal might be to attract and persuade more women to join the community? 

In the Clifton StrengthsFinder , "WOO" is an acronym for "winning others over" and is all about getting to know people and making sure strangers don't remain so for long. I think it is also very fitting for Women of OpenStack. 

(Disclaimer, WOO is in my top 10 strengths so I think it's just peachy!)

I?m in agreement with Anne. I don?t know how much trolling happens on OpenStack channels, but I don?t think it?s a lot. That said, there is a higher likelihood of trolling on a channel identifying itself as for women. Maybe we should consider a little lower profile such as #openstack-woo. Put info in the mailing list, the wikis, etc. 



I would not like to limit the channel to just women. If men are interested in our problems/solutions/discussions, they should be free to participate. As long as they agree to and abide by the terms of participation. I participated in the training session for women in tech dealing with trolling and other issues and it was heavily male, and extremely sympathetic and supportive of reducing the problems encountered by women in tech. They can have valuable insight into defusing situations and supporting us in handling situations. 



On the issue of keeping a record of the channel, I?m undecided. I lean towards not recording the channel, but if someone has a good argument for it, I can easily be swayed. 



My 2 cents.

So I pretty much found out straight away that the "rules" for channels we manage on freenode should allow us to have a private channel as it's for a "diversity type" reason. 





Hi Susie, 


Well... but the TC just passed a resolution to prevent private IRC channels. [1] I'd like to see us agreeing to that guidance. 





I was going to propose we use the existing open #openstack-opw channel, which we use for the Outreach Program for Women, now named Outreachy. Since -opw isn't the name of the program any more, we could rename the channel #openstack-women. 





I've talked to people who run channels with a requirement upon entry of answering the question in the affirmative, "Do you agree to our terms (with a link to the terms)?" If someone doesn't answer or hedges, then they are kicked. If they still come back, but won't agree to the terms, they are banned. Thing is, that turns into a trollbait channel and you have to have 24x7 coverage to ask and if you don't get the answer you need, to kick, then ban the person who won't agree to the terms. I'm not sure we need that level of filter. 





My proposal would be to re-use the existing #openstack-opw channel, renaming to #openstack-women (keeping with some other patterns in open source [2]), and keeping it public. We should also decide if an agreement upon entry is the way we want to go with this to help with the goal of ensuring the channel remains open but with known goals for interaction. 





What do you all think?

We will also need volunteers to write up some documentation with links to websites which are appropriate to 000 baby/completely non technical folk in order to help them get set up and running. A lot of the technology us techies take for granted is very very scary to non-technical people and we need to support all our colleagues not just the techies. 

Currently I was told we needed to run this past the foundation and get it okayed before going ahead. I am not aware of who to speak to or how this needs to be approached. Can the organisers help with this please?

Jessica,
  Thank you SO much for getting this together and the plan for Tokyo is
looking amazing!!  I would LOVE to help but I feel as if I'm on the other
side of the spectrum, meaning I'm in the beginning stages of getting my
hands into Openstack and would love to have a mentor/mentee relationship.
My company has been endorsed by Openstack as the first to use their product
for disaster recovery as a service so I feel we're on the break of
something awesome so I am having to come up to speed pretty quickly on
everything Openstack (which I am loving)!  Is there anything for the
"beginners" to help with in order to gain more knowledge or partner up with
ladies who are the experts?

Thanks again and I'm also looking forward to getting everyones input on the
conversation.

This is great! I think this will be a great means of connecting and working the next steps in preparation for the Tokyo summit. I personally have been consumed last cycle with my team and new job but moving forward would love to be more active and help take this initiative forward!

Hi again all,

I'm not too worried about the name either, other than making sure we get
people in there and it describes why we have the channel. :)

The use case is this:
As a woman on an OpenStack team, I want to ask questions in a safe
environment where I'll get timely answers and won't be judged for not
knowing something.

I think we can fulfill that use case with a new channel, and self-police
any judgement or behavior that doesn't match our needs.

Also, I followed up with Courtney on IRC, and since we do need the -opw
channel specifically for the Outreachy program, we should just start a new
channel.

Here's an example patch adding a new channel:
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/187490/

And here's the docs for IRC permissions within OpenStack:
http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/irc.html

If anyone wants to go ahead and propose the patch, let us know and we'll
get the name sorted. We can vote on the name in gerrit, it's the OpenStack
way! :)

Thanks,
Anne

Ha! I should've looked at my email inbox before hitting send on my last
one. :) Can you add it to
https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/project-config/tree/accessbot/channels.yaml
?

Thanks,
Anne

hihi Melissa,

I wasn't able to attend the working session in Vancouver (was in and out
pretty fast due to conflicts back home / office). One of the things you
might be able to contribute to is writing / documenting your journey of
"coming up to speed" as a newcomer to OpenStack. For many of us who have
been in the community for a while, it can be hard to remember back to those
early days when we were finding our way through the haze. And those early
days were in some ways different than they are today -- less complex with
fewer people and projects to understand.

As you learn your way through OpenStack, what resources were the most
helpful? What questions did you have that you had to find a person to
answer (vs being able to read or watch a video)? What were the ramp up
elements that absolutely required a mentor-type person to be most effective
and what did you do to prepare yourself for the relationship so you could
get the most out of it?

There has been a lot of great work around "onboarding" into OpenStack over
the last several Summits. I've sensed and seen evidence of a desire to
create more mentors in the community, but it can be challenging for a
veteran Stacker to know how best to mentor a newcomer. So from my point of
view, a newcomer eager to help and *needing* to learn OpenStack for their
own professional livelihood seems like a great person to contribute to some
next steps there!

My Scrum Product Owner training wants to tweak the use case just a bit:

As a woman on an OpenStack team, I want to ask questions in a safe
environment where I'll get timely answers and won't be judged for not
knowing something, *so that I can be a fully engaged member of the
OpenStack Community.*

On my company's internal IRC, we have a a channel called "#women-of-ozone".
It started as a bit of a silly fun 2.5+ years ago between myself and
another woman on the engineering team. We were doing something mildly
ridiculous, like sharing cute cat photos, and got into lighthearted "boy vs
girl" jibbing with the men on the channel (it was still a small team and we
all knew each other very well.) #Ozone was an internal team name and core
engineering channel, so I created  "women-of-ozone" or "WOO" to have a
place to share the kitty memes. There were several men that joined as well
and years later it is still around. There are more than a dozen women in
the room from engineering, program management, and product management. We
use it as a place to connect with each other and yes we do share cat
pictures and talk fashion and makeup. More valuable, however,  is being
able to ask questions of each other - be it technical or more nebulous like
leadership styles and career coaching - without any concern of negativity.

All that to say I am THRILLED there is an #openstack-women channel!

Added #openstack-women to the channel listing in here https://review.openstack.org/187745

Thanks for sharing your experience Rainya, I wish #openstack-women turns out to be as great as #women-of-ozone!

My Scrum Product Owner training wants to tweak the use case just a bit: 

As a woman on an OpenStack team, I want to ask questions in a safe environment where I'll get timely answers and won't be judged for not knowing something, so that I can be a fully engaged member of the OpenStack Community. 

On my company's internal IRC, we have a a channel called "#women-of-ozone". It started as a bit of a silly fun 2.5+ years ago between myself and another woman on the engineering team. We were doing something mildly ridiculous, like sharing cute cat photos, and got into lighthearted "boy vs girl" jibbing with the men on the channel (it was still a small team and we all knew each other very well.) #Ozone was an internal team name and core engineering channel, so I created "women-of-ozone" or "WOO" to have a place to share the kitty memes. There were several men that joined as well and years later it is still around. There are more than a dozen women in the room from engineering, program management, and product management. We use it as a place to connect with each other and yes we do share cat pictures and talk fashion and makeup. More valuable, however, is being able to ask questions of each other - be it technical or more nebulous like leadership styles and career coaching - without any concern of negativity. 

All that to say I am THRILLED there is an #openstack-women channel!

+1 to keeping it open to all and not letting trolls dictate anything. #openstack-women is a great name. Anything with woo is not so great. 

I'm looking forward to the channel!

+1 for keeping it as open and accessible as possible. I have said in the past how a room full of women is no more diverse than a room full of men, though I do understand the desire to have groups of all one gender or the other in certain situations. Given the relatively few number of women in tech and how we were not even 10% of the Vancouver summit population, we need as many advocates as we can find to take up the cause of diversity of thought through different genders and cultures. Making it as simple as possibly to our male and female advocates and champions to find us and interact with us seems like a great start. 

As for trolling, I do worry about it, but also don't like making decisions based on what might happen. Additional administrative overhead won't stop the trolls and it adds extra work to the channel leaders. In fact, having such a policy could actually attract more trolls. If they know there is an open channel that makes you agree to something to stay, they might seek it out for a cheap thrill knowing they can get a reaction easily. 

#openstack-opw makes a lot of sense to keep it simple. We could also consider -wos ( W omen [of] O pen S tack, acryonymFinder ), but I do love -woo! 

Merrian-Webster defines woo as "to try to attract (someone, such as a customer, voter, worker, etc.) : to attempt to persuade (someone) to buy something from you, vote for you, work for you, etc." Seems like part of our goal might be to attract and persuade more women to join the community? 

In the Clifton StrengthsFinder , "WOO" is an acronym for "winning others over" and is all about getting to know people and making sure strangers don't remain so for long. I think it is also very fitting for Women of OpenStack. 

(Disclaimer, WOO is in my top 10 strengths so I think it's just peachy!)

I'll add one more voice for keeping it open. Preemptively excluding anyone smacks too much of the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish. 

Rocky's idea of using an acronym instead of ?women is also pretty good, just to keep down trolls searching for a dating channel. I know the name of the group has changed, but since the ?opw already exists, how about we just use it to save the hassle? 

Regarding logging, it looks to be required by the foundation. " All OpenStack related channels shall be logged and made publicly accessible and attempts to notify channel users of that fact shall be undertaken." http://governance.openstack.org/reference/irc.html 

Susie mentioned needing documentation. I wrote a good bit of the "how to use IRC" wiki page for my office, so I already have a lot of material. I'd be glad to help.

I?m in agreement with Anne. I don?t know how much trolling happens on OpenStack channels, but I don?t think it?s a lot. That said, there is a higher likelihood of trolling on a channel identifying itself as for women. Maybe we should consider a little lower profile such as #openstack-woo. Put info in the mailing list, the wikis, etc. 



I would not like to limit the channel to just women. If men are interested in our problems/solutions/discussions, they should be free to participate. As long as they agree to and abide by the terms of participation. I participated in the training session for women in tech dealing with trolling and other issues and it was heavily male, and extremely sympathetic and supportive of reducing the problems encountered by women in tech. They can have valuable insight into defusing situations and supporting us in handling situations. 



On the issue of keeping a record of the channel, I?m undecided. I lean towards not recording the channel, but if someone has a good argument for it, I can easily be swayed. 



My 2 cents.

Hey y'all 

So I pretty much found out straight away that the "rules" for channels we manage on freenode should allow us to have a private channel as it's for a "diversity type" reason. 





Hi Susie, 


Well... but the TC just passed a resolution to prevent private IRC channels. [1] I'd like to see us agreeing to that guidance. 





I was going to propose we use the existing open #openstack-opw channel, which we use for the Outreach Program for Women, now named Outreachy. Since -opw isn't the name of the program any more, we could rename the channel #openstack-women. 





I've talked to people who run channels with a requirement upon entry of answering the question in the affirmative, "Do you agree to our terms (with a link to the terms)?" If someone doesn't answer or hedges, then they are kicked. If they still come back, but won't agree to the terms, they are banned. Thing is, that turns into a trollbait channel and you have to have 24x7 coverage to ask and if you don't get the answer you need, to kick, then ban the person who won't agree to the terms. I'm not sure we need that level of filter. 





My proposal would be to re-use the existing #openstack-opw channel, renaming to #openstack-women (keeping with some other patterns in open source [2]), and keeping it public. We should also decide if an agreement upon entry is the way we want to go with this to help with the goal of ensuring the channel remains open but with known goals for interaction. 





What do you all think? 


Thanks, 


Anne

2. http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/IRC 








Technically I've found a person with admin rights who is willing to help set this up. I'm happy to help with any maintenance if there is any also. I think it should also be non-logged to add to it being a "safe-space" for us to just chat. 

We will also need volunteers to write up some documentation with links to websites which are appropriate to 000 baby/completely non technical folk in order to help them get set up and running. A lot of the technology us techies take for granted is very very scary to non-technical people and we need to support all our colleagues not just the techies. 

Currently I was told we needed to run this past the foundation and get it okayed before going ahead. I am not aware of who to speak to or how this needs to be approached. Can the organisers help with this please? 

Cheers, 

-grue-

Rainya,
  Great advice and thank you do much for the feedback.  I truly appreciate
it!  I've actually starting a notebook of documenting the journey of
learning and coming up to speed with Openstack.  I've found many youtube
videos and past sessions from summits that I've found very helpful.  I'm
beginning to reach out to many of the ladies within the group and hope to
set up some time to chat or possible meet soon.

I've started digging into many areas of Openstack and find it very exciting
to see where this technology is going.  I have an accounting background but
about 4 years ago made the decision to leave the CPA office and join a
technology start up - and I'm SO glad I made that pivot!  I would love if
anyone has any suggestions or have found documents/videos/websites that
have helped them along the way or continue to help in their careers.  I
completely understand the past 2-3 years have changed dramatically for the
senior stackers so it would definitely be beneficial to start engaging more
with them and see how the current versions have shifted the paths to where
Openstack was, where it is now, and what the future holds.

I would love to make the Tokyo summit if timing and the financial side of
things work out but until then I'll be diving into the OpenStack ways!

Hope everyone is having a great Wednesday!

Hi,

I'm wondering where to begin. I've been a programmer for 15 years and I
stumbled upon this list.  I've been a Rackspace client for a year so
naturally I started hearing more about the OpenStack project. Anyway, I
became very interested and wanted to get involved but have no idea where to
start digging. If anyone has any guidance I'd love to hear from you.

Best,
Laura

Hello Laura,
I think it depends what you are interested in, but if you have not tried it yet, install devstack and play with different projects:http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/
See which projects you like, and decide whether you want to work on coding OpenStack, or code apps that use OpenStack APIs, or both. If you are not interested in coding, there are a lot of other options as well.

Hope this helps!
-Egle

Hi Egle,

Nice to meet you! Yes, I'm totally interested in coding. Thanks for the
link to the devstack. Would this be the list to contact if I stumble into
any problems with the setup or are there other lists that I should also be
part of?

Thanks,
Laura

Laura,

You should join IRC channels - #openstack-101, #openstack-dev,
#openstack-women on freenode server for quick reply.

Also you can join developer mailing list of OpenStack -
http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev

Folks -
Sadly I missed the poll, so I guess I will just rely on the meetings to 
be at a time I can make.  I am interested in participating in the 
Diversity Working Group.  One problem for me is that I do not have 
access to IRC at work, so during the day is not great for me.

Folks -
I am ready and able to put together another WOOS (Women of OpenStack) 
Summit Panel.  The last panel was a big success and we didn't get too 
many hecklers this time!  I would like to propose a talk on overcoming 
subtle bias in teams and in the workplace.  Here is the first pass at 
the panel proposal.

*Overcoming Subtle Bias ? Sponsored by Women of OpenStack*

The Women of Openstack Working Group continues to go from strength to 
strength. With a record of over 600 women or 10% of the Vancouver Summit 
attendees, women are a growing and vocal presence in our extremely 
diverse community. Join this panel of women and minorities as we discuss 
the topic of subtle bias in the workplace and the OpenStack community 
and how to remove barriers to full participation in all aspects and roles.

>From PTL to code reviewer, there is a place for everyone to contribute 
to the fullest extent possible. Learn how to identify and overcome the 
subtle biases that can drag down even the most confident person.

?Identifying our own biases and tips for avoiding their influence

?Looking beyond the surface: First impressions and how they can sway 
even the most seemingly impartial decision

?On an IRC, everyone is equal: Using tools to level the playing field 
for everyone

?Establishing criteria to ensure fair treatment for all

If you would like to join me, I am looking for 3-4 more people for the 
panel.  It doesn't have to be all women!   If you are interesting please 
send me your information and we can talk.

Nalee,

This is a very thought provoking diagram.  I want to digest it a bit, but I
think it could open up a lot points for discussion.  Thank you for putting
this together and sharing it with us.

Sue

Hi. Sue

Nowadays. I am looking IT Trend.

I think OpenSource is very popular trend in IT.
so I wanted to find OpenSource in OpenStack.
maybe this fact know many people who works with openstack.
but any people doesn't think to express picture.
so I just expressed picture it. and I wanted to share it.

I hope you understand my English.

Thank you.

Hey ladies who like open source, see below.

Subject: Need some help finding women working on open source projects

For my day job, I'm putting together an open source "science fair" with The
New York Times Developers on July 15 (from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m.) and I'd
really, really love to have more women demoing projects they've worked on.

The evening is setup like a high school science fair (see photos from our
event in 2012: http://photos.rajiv.com/2012/Open-source-science-fair/).

We're interested in things that are fun and useful ? beyond that we're very
open minded. If you know of any female devs who'd like to show their work,
please let me know: Chrys at nytimes.com

Thanks very much!

  ?Chrys
