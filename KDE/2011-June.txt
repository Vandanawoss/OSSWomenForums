Subject: [Kde-women] contributing to "The Architecture of Open Source
	Applications"
Message-ID: <4DEE7E80.5000600@third-bit.com>

Hello,

We just released a book titled "The Architecture of Open Source 
Applications", the content of which is also available online under a 
Creative Commons license at http://aosabook.org. The project's 
over-arching aim is to show people how complex applications are 
designed,  and why they are designed that way; as we say in the 
introduction, we want people to explain what the major components of 
their applications, how they work together (or don't), and most 
importantly, why that design was chosen, and what has been learned along 
the way.

We are now gearing up to do a second volume, and are looking for 
contributions that reflect and encourage diverse participation in open 
source software development. If you might be willing to write a 
chapter-length description of a medium-to-large open source application  
that you have worked on, or if you know someone who might want to do so, 
please get in touch with us at aosa at aosabook.org. Please note that all 
royalties from sales will be donated directly to Amnesty International, 
so you'll be helping a couple of good causes at once.

Thanks for your time --- we look forward to hearing from you.
