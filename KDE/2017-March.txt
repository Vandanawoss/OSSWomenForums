Hi,



This is a request for your participation in a web-based online survey on
women in open source software. This is survey is part of a research project

communities and to develop a better understanding of opportunities and
challenges in this setting.

 Your participation in this survey is voluntary. You may refuse to take
part in the research or exit the survey at any time without penalty. You
are free to decline to answer any particular question you do not wish to
answer for any reason.



You will receive no direct benefits from participating in this research
study. However, your responses may help us learn more about the status of
women in open source software development.



At the end of the survey you will be asked if you are interested in
participating in an additional interview [by phone, via video conferencing
or email]. If you chose to volunteer for this interview, you will provide
contact information to the researcher and therefore your survey responses
will no longer be anonymous to the researcher. There is a possible risk of
breach of confidentiality if you chose to interview via email. The
researcher has signed a confidentiality pledge to maintain your
confidentiality at all stages. No names or identifying information would be
included in any publications or presentations based on these data, and your
responses will remain confidential. The interview will be recorded and
transcribed. The transcribed interviews will be stored on OneDrive with
transmission and storage encryption to ensure confidentiality. After one
year, the interview tapes will be destroyed.  All the identifiers from the
transcribed data will be removed and data with no identifiers will be
stored and used for further analysis. The recordings from the interview
will be destroyed within one year of the creation of the recording.
