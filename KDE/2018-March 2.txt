Hi all,

Thanks to a confirmed sponsorship from the GNOME Foundation, GNOME is participating in Outreachy in the upcoming May round! Outreachy has a new system for listing project ideas and for applying for the program, and all project ideas need to be added through this system by mentors by March 7. This means that if you would like to propose a new project idea for Outreachy, or if you would like to propose the same idea you proposed for GSoC, or if you are already working with a prospective candidate on a project idea, you *have to add it by any time on March 7* at https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/gnome/submit-project/ Mentors or applicants will not be able to propose new project ideas for this round of Outreachy after that.

Because GNOME only usually has a few participants in Outreachy, we are looking to offer projects that are most strategic for GNOME. These include, but are not limited to, projects in the area of privacy, GTK+, core experience, core applications, developer experience, and development infrastructure.

Outreachy application deadline is March 22. Please also consider applying or encouraging others to apply with the help of the resources at https://www.outreachy.org/promote/ More information about GNOME's participation in Outreachy is available at https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/Outreachy

Please feel free to e-mail gnome-outreachy-list@gnome.org , which is a private mailing list with Outreachy coordinators and mentors for GNOME, with any questions.

Thanks,
Marina
