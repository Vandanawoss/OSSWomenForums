Subject: [Kde-women] We are all awesome
Message-ID: <CABe7M6t5q0f2PC_DGCxzbrHVTLaQ6TPuM9-EAF6OFZdXQgJMvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Just found this website: http://weareallaweso.me/
Another interesting idea to get more women to talk :)

"Are you a woman who wants more female speakers at developer
conferences? I have a quick fix for you: become one.

Think of the other female developers you know. Do you expect those
women to step forward as speakers and not yourself? The only person
you control is you, and so I?m asking you: become a speaker."

IMHO, there is a bunch of women around the world doing awesome work in
free sofware, programming...etc, we just don't show too much what we
are doing. I think.
While men easily get proud of themselves, even with their fart, we
need to do so much more to get there. (I hope you got the point hehe)

Cheers,
Camila Ayres

Message-ID: <CAA0Jy_wHXTUDroROhofmd2XMGKNmhE4ajmBwp39f7yczo9ZV5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Here are my notes from the women's outreach BoF at Akademy 2012 -
thanks to everyone who participated! Please add anything that I forgot
to mention and give feedback if you have additional ideas or comments.
Do we want to publish something on women.kde.org? Or does someone feel
like blogging about this? Do we have a wiki to collect more ideas?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* We were approx. 10-12 people, mostly women, 2-3 men were also present.
*  Quick introduction round
* The group agreed that KDE is already quite diverse and doing well at
being welcoming to women and men alike. The question is: how do we
make this more visible to people outside of the community so that we
get even more women involved?
* Carl mentioned the outreach program of the University of Bellingham,
that got a big grant from the Association of Women in Computing [1].
Could we work with the uni or this association?
* In order to get more people, especially women, involved in KDE and
Free Software in general, you need to show role models, and lower the
barrier to get involved
* Lydia mentioned the IRC tutorials that she and others organised for
Ada Lovelace-Day 2011 [2].
* We discussed if IRC tutorials are helpful/successful - agreement
that they are good but only attract women that are already familiar
with IRC and not necessarily newbies
*  We briefly touched on the question if there is a difference in why
women get involved in FLOSS and why men get involved. The women
present shared their stories and motivations and the conclusion was
that there are probably no differences. Reasons for joining that were
mentioned:
  ** good company / "my people"
  ** career possibilities
  ** learning new, valuable things
  ** doing something valuable for society
  ** KDE as a whole more welcoming than other FLOSS projects
  ** KDE is such a large, mature project that everyone can find their niche
  ** KDE is well documented so it is easy to find information on how
to get involved
  ** if you commit a change or write an article, your work is visible
to you and others
* A question from Clemens showed that there are women in all kinds of
roles in KDE but just two female maintainers
* Valorie made the point that KDE is welcoming as such, but not
welcoming to women in particular. There seems to be a lacking
awareness that there are not enough women involved.
* Runa commented saying that a special women's outreach program might
give men the impression they are not being valued or that they might
get censored
* A short discussion about which message we want to send with women's
outreach activities: we want this to be a positive message, showing
that we would like even more women to get involved. We do not want to
focus on problems.
* Ada Lovelace Day 2012 is on October 16th [3]
* Suggestions from a brainstorming on what actions we could take:
  ** Organise IRC or Google hangout tutorials again for Ada Lovelace Day
  ** Organise an in person coding workshop similar to Railsgirls workshops [4]
  ** blog posts/ "Behind KDE " interviews with women involved with KDE
(not necessarily as a "Women in KDE series" but just to show that
there are women involved, too).
  ** create a new "Women in KDE" video, see [5]
  ** coordinate with http://adainitiative.org/
  ** pre-Akademy (Friday afternoon) Women's get-together (bring male friends?)
  ** Women's track/ conference day during Akademy or some other
conference. Example was: the women's miniconf during linuxconf.au [6]
  ** Get inspiration from http://openhatch.org/
  ** Women mentoring program, not paid, but organise a women in KDE
sprint or a showcase of the contributions at Akademy and
invite/sponsor those who were successful (similar to GSOC students)
  ** share ideas and experiences with the women from the GNOME women's
outreach program
  ** use the "Team Health Check" tool created by CWG to see how well
your team does in terms of diversity
  ** Talk to Linuxchix or Ubuntu Women
  ** make use of women.kde.org
  ** get guys involved: it is great if guys also speak up on this
topic and show their support

Now it's up to us to take the next steps :)-

Hi,

Ada Lovelace day is gonna be at October 16th this year, so might be a good 
idea to start to prepare ourselves for it.

- We need ideas for a shortish and easy tutorial that ends up in something 
working and running, or for example, a piece of text translated somewhere 
(@Aracele!!).
- Have in mind that people have to know in advance what they need to have 
installed, prepared in their computer to follow the tutorial. 
- Also, one day in advance, have a help session for people to get their system 
set up.
- What do you prefer: do it through IRC or Google Hangout?
- Depending on how much people will be able to do the tutorial, we could 
spread out over 1 week.

Lydia and I made a list with some names that we thought could be willing to do 
one tutorial - that's why you are receiving this e-mail :) If you know someone 
else that could be included and if you have any differents ideas for Ada 
Lovelace Day, please let us know. 

Let's help other to get involved in KDE!

Cheers,

Hi. Good thinking.

I'd just make two additional points:

1) irc is preferred especially if we can find a web link somewhere so they 
don't _have_ to install an irc client, but can just use a browser.

2) Having people accomplish a real task, which the community appreciate, 
makes for a better experience, and makes it more likely they will actually 
stay. So it would probably be a good idea to start thinking about real tasks 
that attendants can accomplish. 

And bonus points if we can make this a group task where all attendants (incl 
us) already form a sub-community and ending the day/week with some real 
product. This way we also show this important and cool side of foss/kde. It 
will require some more pre-planning from our side, but I think it will be 
worth it.

To answer my own question:

http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=kde-women

would make it easy for anyone to join irc

I'm wondering on the type of tutorial to do: code, translation, QA? I would
realy like code most, I have learned about translation & QA as a more
"female" subjects. What do you think?

If you want to do a code-related tutorial that has something to do
with KDE that'd be awesome too. I was thinking maybe something about
the commit digest from you. Maybe you want to do both?

What about the rest? Do you have any ideas for your tutorials?

Another thing: I think we should make this a "women and their friends
event" again like last year - meaning we'll focus on making this a
great event for women to get into KDE but men are welcome too as long
as they are respectful of the event and it's participants.


Cheers
Lydia

Cool, I would love to participate again, last year was great fun. I
have in mind something similar to last year, an IRC course. Sadly the
Google+ hangout is not going to work fin if there are more than a few
participants, so I still prefer IRC :)

Great.
FYI: This time we have Hangout on Air afaiu. This should work a lot
better than last year and more like a broad-cast for most people. You
can of course also do a IRC tutorial. Up to you really.

Hi,

I'll be happy to participate/help someone at whatever is decided. Currently on vacation until end of August (kids have awfully long holidays!)

Marta I watched the video of your talk at Akademy, awesome and enjoyable and very useful!

Myriam what happened to you? Reading between lines I understood you broke your legs? If it's true I wish you the best of recovery!

Best regards to all,

Anne-Marie

I could perhaps chip in with a small tutorial on grooming translation tasks for
a professional result, maybe as an extension to my open-advice article. Does
that sound sensible?

Well, if it is really better than last year we can go for it, no problem for me.

Yes, both at the same time, luckily after we held our BoF for the
Quality team, but I am already half time into the bone mending, so it
is coming together slowly.

Thanks for caring :)

I think I was mistaken by thinking that we're going for one tutorial. If
there are
more, there are more options :)
However, I'm offline around Oct 16. I can record something,
test/review/help in
another way, but won't be there live.

Cheers,
Marta

Hi everybody!

Good idea Camila!
I can do a tutorial about translation or about how non-programmers can to
collaborate with KDE. ;-)
I suggest that we make a frame of possible activities so we can have a
preview of the event.

Cheers!

As far as I understood, still there is space for talks:

I believe that would be interesting.

Yes, this looks interesting and I have already registered.

This seems to be an unconference, so everyone can host a session :).

Do it, Camila :)

Message-ID: <CAA0Jy_wp3T86QUVmW0-54PQq_Z-uOOA53T+DGicQAYUE2L8hTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Yesterday, I saw a tweet [1] saying that GUADEC has 17% female
attendees, which is quite I good number. This prompted me to check our
female attendee stats, and unfortunately, they don't look that great.
If I counted right, from 250 attendees only 25 (10%) were women. The
numbers might be not entirely correct as we checked off people
manually, but I don't think that the total picture would change.

GNOME attributes this to their Women's Outreach program, here's an
article from Der Standard, in German [2].

Cheers,
Claudia

Hey everyone, sorry for top-posting and being late, I was offline
during the last days.

As I already told Lydia, I am available for a coding tutorial,
preferably via G+ Hangout or similar. I'll add some stuff to the doc
soon.
