Text for review:
-------------------------------------------------------
KDE-women is a group of women in the KDE community. We are here to
help increase the number of women in Open Source and to support each
other. KDE is an friendly and open community and one of the Open
Source projects with the highest rate of female contributors. It
strives through its diversity.

A couple of grammatical things I noticed in the previous paragraph: I
think that "KDE is a friendly and open community..." is more correct
than "KDE is an friendly and open community..." Also, "It strives for
diversity" might make more sense than striving through diversity. Hope
that helps.

Some of the things we do:
- helping find women find the right place for them to contribute
- encourage women to give talks at conferences like Akademy, the
annual KDE conference
- provide support in difficult situations

and most importantly we make KDE rock more each day ;-)


To contact us please join our mailinglist at
http://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-women

In my opinion, Aaron's edits make the above text better.

This should read: help women find the right place to contribute

....such as Akademy.....

How about "provide mutual support"

Thanks folks :)

http://community.kde.org/KDE_Women is now up and running. I will ask
sysadmin to redirect women.kde.org there in a minute.


Cheers

Looking good! The sentences "KDE is a friendly and open community and
one of the Open Source projects with the highest rate of female
contributors. It strives through its diversity." -- the last bit still
troubles me.

Do we mean, Diversity makes our project rock. Or, Diversity makes our
project shiny / awesome / amazing. "It strives through its diversity"
just doesn't quite hit the nail on the head.

My two lil cents,

Valorie

I am not sure I can tell the difference between those two. But feel
free to edit the wiki page to make it clearer.
