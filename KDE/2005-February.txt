Subject: [Kde-women] How do women become involved with free and open source
	software?
Message-ID: <421E239B.4060101@axionet.com>

On the Debian Women's list, Helen's Faulkner commented that "women 
follow a different route to being interested in things like Debian and 
FOSS compared to the average man." I'm a writer, contributing regularly 
to Newsforge, and I've already covered Debian Women, so this comment 
made me curious.

Is it true? If so, what is that path? If anyone would care to comment or 
share their experience, please write to me directly.

Fair warning: I am asking with the possibility of doing an article for 
Newsforge. If you prefer not to have your personal experiences mentioned 
in an article, then you might not want to answer.

(If anyone contacts me privately, I won't use material marked as 
off-record, and I won't use your name if you ask me not to.)

Thanks,
