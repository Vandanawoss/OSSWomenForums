All,

Leigh Honeywell forwarded me the cfp for the Outreach Program for Women. I was immediately intrigued...and then immediately too intimidated to apply. With Leigh's guidance I have worked my way up to asking a few questions. She thinks my experience as a sociologist, corporate trainer, and writer might be of use to a project. I study organizations and inequality. Media organizations often come up in the course of my work. My immediate work is in higher education organizations, particularly those that operate for-profit and not-for-profit. In a previous life I wrote training manuals for a six week corporate program for Sprint. The manuals were not far off in style from software documentation: we had to pay attention to end-user experience, flow of information, and clear instructional language.

So that's me, in a nutshell. Any ideas about how I might be of use as an applicant are appreciated.

Hey! :)

Your background definitely looks interesting and I am sure we could
find something for you.
Just as a gut feeling: What do you think you could do that might be
useful for KDE and that interests you? THat would help a lot in
helping you refine it.

Cheers
Lydia

Thank you for asking Lydia.

My gut instinct when I read through projects was that my corporate writing and academic research skills would be good for writing documentation. Part of how I market myself professionally is as a translator of sorts for academic-ese. Thus, my public writing on academic issues in non-academic presses.

I would also be interested in developing my interests in user design. I had to design a university website a year ago and I got into wire-framing user flow and design as part of the development process. I've since become fascinated by all the implicit assumptions about users that are embedded in each interface decision.

Great! In this area Anne can probably help you most. She's the master
of userbase.kde.org.

For this the kde-usability mailinglist might be a good start. (Don't
be shy - they're nice.)
