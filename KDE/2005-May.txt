Hi,

I've been the list administrator for kde-women since its beginning in 2001 and 
I hope everybody was confident. In the last month though I noticed that other 
tasks are taking more and more time. 
Therefore I'd like to pass on the list administration to somebody else. It's 
not much work, you just have to let through an email from time to time or 
discard some spam. Ideally two women would share the job. Who steps up?
I still will be around of course and not disappear completely.

Greetings,
eva

Hi Eva,

I would apply for the job. I already know the kde mailinglist system and
how to approve or discard mails, so it isn't any problem for me to take
over the list administration, if this is ok for everybody.

Cheers,
Frauke

Hi Frauke,

great, that you want to take over. You were on my list of people I was hoping 
to receive an answer from :-)

I added you as list administrator. I hope you find a second administrator for 
times your are not available (we all need holiday from time to time, don't 
we? ;-).

Greetings,
eva

Hi!

For everyone who isn't reading planetkde.org...
There is a really interesting post about the KDE Community and Women who
 contributes to KDE. I want to thank Scott Wheeler right here that he
pleads for equality and respectfullness. Btw he is one of our male
supporters :)
