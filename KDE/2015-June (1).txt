Subject: [Kde-women] Ohio LinuxFest 2015 Call for Presentations
Message-ID: <0MhTLo-1YiPuU3YSQ-00MfnA@mrelay.perfora.net>

The 2015 Ohio LinuxFest is looking for presentations on Friday and
Saturday, October 2 and 3.  Please visit the CFP page
<https://ohiolinux.org/CFP> for full details about submitting a
proposal.  The deadline is Friday, July 17, but the sooner you can
submit a talk, the better.

Started in 2003, the Ohio LinuxFest <https://ohiolinux.org/> is an
annual grassroots conference in Columbus, Ohio.  We are very keen to
see increased participation and visibility of women in our community.
Presentations relating to any free and open source software, not just
Linux, are welcome.  Relevant topics include networking, system
administration, user interaction, development, and community building
but are certainly not limited to these.

Our audience consists of people at all skill levels.  Prior speaking
experience is a plus, although we do try to provide opportunities for
first-time speakers.  If you have any questions, please contact us at
<speakers at ohiolinux.org>.  We look forward to hearing from you!

Speaker Chair, 2015 Ohio LinuxFest
