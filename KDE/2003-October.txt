Hi everybody,

	My name is Ines Sombra and I was wondering if you already have a
spanish translator. I'm a native of Argentina but I'm currently living
on Missouri, USA (will move to Texas to start working on my masters
soon). I would really like to contribute to your project; so if you
ladies have room or tasks for another one I'll be glad to help.

Thanks for taking the time to read me :)

Ines

Hi Ines,

we need translators for almost every language. Do you want to translate 
for KDE in general or especially the website of KDE women? We need for 
both tasks help. And I think you will soon find a lot of stuff that 
needs a spanish translasion. We are working currently at a translation 
file for the website and I would be glad if you would start helping us 
with the translation. You're of course welcome in the project :)

Frauke

p.s. Sorry for the late answer... :(

Hello Frauke,

	I would love to help on both! Where do I begin? I have the guides about 
documentation that are on the KDE internationalization page but do I 
need anything else?

Hope you have a nice weekend,

Ines

Hi again :)

Ok, for translating kde applications you should send the language 
coordinatot a mail. For spanish it is jaime@kde.org. And you can 
subscribe on the mailinglist for spanish translations by sending a 
message to majordomo@kybs.de with the words "subscribe kde-es" in the 
body. That are the first steps. I think Jaime can explain you how the 
spanish translation works. Every language modul is a bit different.

For translating the women.kde.org website I will become coordinator I 
guess and we'll use this mailinglist for things that should be 
discussed. I am currently working on building up a structure for 
translating the website. Unfortunately we'll have to wait a bit until a 
.pot file is created for the website. I'm already talking with some 
people to get the .pot file generated and I hope that it doesn't take 
long at all. As soon as the .pot file is generated and the translation 
of the website can begin, I will send an email over this mailinglist to 
tell you and all other interested women, how the structure of the 
translation will be and how to translate the website. I hope it will not 
much differ from the translation of an application.

I hope this information help a bit :)

Cheers,
Frauke

Hi Michaela,
sure there will be need for a swedish translation. We need help for 
every language that exists. If you want you can also help with the 
translation into german.
maybe you read my last mail, I send two minutes ago, where I explained, 
that the translation of the website will start as soon as the .pot file 
is generated.
So, I hope you will contribute to KDE women too :)

Cheers,
Frauke

Hi, all,
reading your message from yesterday I thought you might also need a translator 
into Polish language. I am a Polish native speaker who quite fluently speaks 
English, German and Spanish and would want to join the project of translation 
for KDE in general or the website of KDE women.

Greets,
Maria

Hi Maria,
nice to see that you want to translate too.
For general KDE translation to Polish you should visit the website
http://i18n.kde.org/teams/index.php?action=info&team=pl
where you find some information about the polish translation team, there 
mailinglist and coordinators. That should be a good starting point for 
you to get in contact with the coordinators and translators of the 
polish translation team.
For the website I can just repeat that I will drop a mail to this list 
as soon as the .pot file is ready.
I am glad to see that so many women are interested in translation and I 
want to say to you and all other interested women, welcome to KDE Women 
and the translation teams!

Cheers,
Frauke

Indeed, I am also very glad. I'd esp like to thank also Frauke for taking up 
the maintenance of the kde-women pages and I am very happy to see the project 
going on!

Thank you very much for you work!

That's no problem. I love to see that kde-women is back again and that

Hi Tara,
of course we need an Arabic translator. If you want to translate the KDE 
applications as well as the website you can contact the oordinator of 
the arabic translation team for translating the applications. His mail 
adress is contact(at)arabeyes(dot)org. You also can find some 
information about translating for that team at 
http://i18n.kde.org/teams/index.php?action=info&team=ar
For the kde-women website I hope you'll help too and I only can say 
welcome to KDE Women.
I will hopefully soon have the translation file ready and then I'll send 
a mail about this list.

Cheers and welcome,
Frauke

Subject: [Kde-women] Many many ideas! Would you like to help?
Message-ID: <BAY10-F80KAAxDCrV0000010f0f@hotmail.com>

Hi,

Here are some ideas for the women.kde-org website and our project in 
general. There were a lot of discussions about the project and the tasks we 
try to fullfill.
These mail should give a general idea about, what we have in mind :)
This is just a proposal, feel free to flame/add/suppress/critisize/improve 
;-)

A very big idea is to have a database full of tasks, that need to be done, 
and to get women and
the whole community to do stuff. We, the women, would provide the tools 
(webpages, forms, HowTos...) and would be a sort of "motor" for all these 
points.

The database should use mysql and this can be used for the website. So, we 
can use forms for enter new tasks and for getting assigned to a task.

There will be a lot of tasks, that are to do, and they aren't only for 
developers. You should find there a lot of tasks that can be done without 
knowing a programming language and that can be done from everyone who wants 
to start to contribute or is contributing already. An example for such tasks 
can be KHangMan, which would need some improvement at the icons or reviewing 
a list of words, that needs some language work. That is only one example and 
there can be found easily a lot of more tasks like this.

There will be a database of applications that need short explanations for 
the whatsthis help. About that aseigo wrote a tutorial that really helps to 
get started with writing whatsthis and can be found at 
http://urbanlizard.com/~aseigo/whatsthis_tutorial/ . But there isn't only 
the work to write new whatsthis, also to find out which applications need 
whatsthis and make a list of them. (that can be shared between us)
This would be separated in 2 categories:
- the apps that needs the whatsthis help and use QtDesigner (easy)
- the apps that needs the whatsthishelp and don't use QtDesigner (less easy)
Therfore there has to be a form as well to get assigned to an application to 
work on.

Problem: as we are in feature freeze, time will be limited to add strings
until the i18n freeze. Do we have time to get this in place before this
freeze? If not, see what branch to work on for 3.3.

A list of classes that don't have API doc can be generated and how to write 
this doc
    (that's more for developers)

A tutorial about how to translate is in progress and hopefully we can start 
soon with translating our website. We are just waiting for the translation 
file and every translator is welcome.

List the KDE apps that do not have a User Guide i.e. a proper doc and try
to get people to write docs or part of a doc.
Lauri: what do you think about that? Would that interfere with your team
work? It's just an idea as I noticed new features/apps in 3.2 have no doc
yet. But I don't want to mess with other people work. If it's not such a
good idea, we'll drop it. We can just add a contact for people who would
like to help with that instead.

List some small bugs in KDE apps. For example, one could use the KControl
Center and see if all the buttons are consistent (I noticed for example that
some Apply are enabled even if any change was made, this is an error). See
if all keyboard shortcuts are consistent. See if each app can be used via
the keyboard without the mouse (ask in accessibility about that, I saw a
mail on that and it seems to me very important yet developers usually
concentrate on big features, not on small stuff)
See how to fix that. Are the menus consistent (for example in Games or in
Edu)

Make a list of wanted apps. I often meet new developers and they don't
know what to code. In the Edutainment area, there can be things to be done:
an app to make kids learn the time, a simple paint program for very young
kids with stamps, .... I am sure that you have many ideas!

I believe that if we can succeed in partially solve all those small 
problems, we'll make KDE really better for the end user.
We, KDE-Women, can provide the website and maintainance of all that, plus
being involved as well. We'll also lead the translation of KDE websites as
we'll be the first one to use i18n. Now, don't we rock?

Those are just some ideas of what could be done in KDE by us.

If we agree on some points, we can then share ideas on how to do it.

Best regards,

annma & frauke

It's just not as simple as 'pick an app, write some stuff', potential writers 
need to be able to use CVS for instance, since there's no point writing about 
the last version of something.  It's better if they contact me first, so I 
can keep track of who is working on what.

So, new writers are always welcome, but this, and many other things, are 
already on the "Open jobs" list on www.kde.org.  

Why don't you just work on improving and updating that page instead of 
duplicating it on another site?

In fact, I think it would be better for KDE overall if resources were 
concentrated on the main KDE sites.  A translation tutorial, for instance, 
makes most sense as an adjunct or addition to the translation how-to (well 
it's more than a how-to, it's practically a book) on i18n.kde.org, a how-to 
on how to write API docs would be natural for developer.kde.org.  Anything I 
could write to guide a new docs volunteer would be a duplication of chunks of 
i18n.kde.org/docs/

Wouldn't it be better to make the project "improve the existing resources" 
than to duplicate parts of them?

Hello Lauri,

	Yes, I agree with you; we shouldn't re-invent the wheel and re-write 
existing documentation. At the same time, what I've seen done is a mini 
how-to by the "project leader" with all the references to the 
documentation you talk about as a welcoming thing.
	The guys in the spanish translation team have a 2 page 
"welcome-on-board-and-this-is-where-you-start" link that they send to 
every person that joins the project so it might be a bit redundant for 
kde-women to have one but it's a better alternative than having to 
explain it over and over on the list. I also think it gives newbies the 
"personal" touch that they look for when they join.

:)

Message-ID: <3F9BD6DA.60805@kde.org>

Hey everyone,

since a while I am thinking about a KDE Women meeting and I am wondering 
if you all are interested in meeting each other.
So I thought I just drop a mail here and ask you all what you think 
about it :)

A KDE Women meeting needs a lot of organization and I think it isn't 
possible to have one before summer 2004. But if we start now with 
preparations we could meet in the next summer and have a lot of fun 
together. Therefor I would like to know how much you are interested
in meeting each other and if you have any ideas for a program.

Maybe everyone who wants to have a meeting could send me a private mail, 
that you would like to participate at the meeting and where you are 
from. If you know when you have holidays in the summer (e.g. when you 
have school holidays or something like that) you could add that.
So I could have a look, if you all want a meeting and where to locate a 
meeting. Any ideas for a program are welcome too.

You can also send a mail to the mailinglist about the meeting, but 
please send a seperated mail to me, when you want to participate. This 
mail isn't binding, it is just to give me an overview.

I hope to meet you all :)

Cheers,
Frauke

Sounds like a good idea -- although it is also a question of funding.

I'd love to see a little conference program with programming workshops
and the like. 

The meeting itself should include a weekend as not everyone is a
student, and planning of holidays in many companies isn't that easy.

Sure it is a question of funding and this mail is first of all to check 
if there are interested women. I think it is very good to have an idea 
how many would like to have a meeting before we start to organize and 
plan in detail. We have to talk to the KDE e.V as well when we want to 
organize a meeting. They can help us with funding etc. But at the moment 
I would love to see if enough women would like to participate. So please 
send me all a mail, when you want to meet us all.

I think it is a good idea to have a programming workshop, maybe annma 
could explain a bit about working with KDevelop and the QT Designer, and 
   stuff like this. A little conference program would be very great, and 
everyone who would like to do actively a workshop could send me a mail 
too :)

That's right, and we will think about this in the organization :)

Hello all,

will this meeting be held at? I just had to ask ;)

Hi Ines,

we don't know yet. We want to find a place, where most of the women can 
participate. So, I would love to know in which countries you all live. 
We will try to find the best location, but I can't promise that it will 
be the best one for every one.

This questioning if you want to participate is just to have an overview 
and to see in which country a meeting could take place. I can't say it 
take place in Germany, Spain, France, or somewhere else. At the moment 
we even don't know if many women would like to have a meeting. So, as 
soon I think the answering to my mail is stopping, I will write a mail 
to the list and tell you all if there is interest to have a meeting.

I guess, Ines, you have interest, because you asked where it will take 
place. I made a little tablet to note down how many women want a 
meeting. Maybe you send me a mail too, that you would like to have a 
meeting and where you are coming from. It would be very great to meet 
you and the other women, but I can't promise anything yet.

So, I would ask you all, to send me a mail when you are interested in 
having a meeting. It is just if you want one, it is not binding that you 
have to participate, when a meeting is organized. I hope you all will 
come and have a good time.

Cheers,
Frauke

Hi all,

I am interested in a meeting. In Europe in July or early August would do. I 
live in Canada but I am planning some holiday in France next summer.

If it's possible for me to come, I would be happy to give a talk about 
KDevelop && QtDesigner and to answer all (not too difficult) questions about 
KDE development.

Of course maybe it will be difficult to find a location suitable for 
everyone. In any case, we can do some IRC meetings at the same time.

Melbourne, Australia would be good :) Seriously, why not include an 
IRC session on the weekend to talk to everyone that couldn't make it?

Hi all,
I think an IRC session would be really good. That's just a question of
the organization and I think that we find a solution for that.

You are all spreaded around the world, so we need something for everyone
who can't be at the meeting and IRC is one of the easiest ways to
organize a online meeting. 

I don't know if it is possible to have an online conference, but I'm
sure we find the best way to include every woman, who wants to
participate, if online or real. 

Cheers,
Frauke

Hi,

I wasn't able to read all your mails since I was busy with a linux fair the 
last days. I'd just like to throw this into the discussion:

There are also plans to have another KDE conference next year, either late 
August and somewhere in central Europe (Netherlands, France, Germany) or in 
late September south Europe (Spain),  but it's not decided yet. What about 
joining the efforts here? 

As this year we again want to have a conference part first and a one week 
hacking session afterwards. I don't think it would be any problem to get a 
seperate room for kde-women activities. Financial as well as human ressources 
are very limited in KDE e.V. and I really suggest to join the meetings. 

Tell me, what you think about it.

Greetings,
eva

Impossible for me late August in France (kids start school late August - 
early September) and probably also impossible late September because I won't 
be able to pay the plane ticket. In July or early August I'll go to France 
on holiday.
Known developers can maybe get some financial support but I doubt I will.

It is of course possible to join the KDE conference, we don't want to 
separate from that of course. It depends on how many women can make it.
<wish>And maybe the KDE conference will be split soon in several countries 
(happening at the same time at different places) so that we, outside Europe, 
feel not too much outside it...
