Hi to all;

For a long time i have been searching a solution to
this error:

cd .. && /bin/sh ./config.status tavlam/Makefile
depfiles 
config.status: error: invalid argument: depfiles 
gmake: *** [Makefile] Error 1 

and while searching ,i met your mailing list and i am
here 

i read your documentation about Qt Designer and
KDevelop.i have some questions:

1) why i have the error about depfiles??how can i fix
it?

2)"In the KDevelop menu File select New then click on
Qt2 User Interface (*.ui) in the box that appears.
Type in sigcreatedlg in the Filename text field at the
top and click OK" i did it it is ok but 

"Then Qt Designer opens and ask you to choose a
template for the new form. " it does not work i don't
have the new form!!why?(i installed qt designer and
set the path in kdevelop)

thanks to all
ZP

Hallo!
Can you tell me, when your error occurs? It is hard to debug an error without 
knowing when it happens. :) 
Can you also tell me which system do you use and what KDE version you use? 
Also it would be very useful to know what version you have from KDevelop and 
Qt :) The Tutorial is some days old I guess, and I don't know if you use the 
new version of Qt, so that you got problems because of this differences. 
Maybe I can help you.

Yours,
