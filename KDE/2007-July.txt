Subject: [Kde-women] So Cal Linux Expo Announces Call For Papers
Message-ID: <200707271213.59034.g@socallinuxexpo.org>

July 27th, 2007

The Linux Expo of Southern California has opened the Call For Papers for 
the 6th Annual Southern California Linux Expo, to be held February 8th, 
9th, & 10th, 2008. As with SCALE 5x, S6x will be held at the Westin 
Hotel at Los Angeles International Airport.

If you?re interested in speaking at SCALE, don?t wait to submit your 
proposal. Over their last couple of events, the Linux Expo has had many 
more applications than they have had speaker slots available. See 
http://socallinuxexpo.org/scale6x/documents/scale6x-cfp.pdf for details 
on how to apply for a speaking opportunity at SCALE.

Likewise, if you know someone who has something interesting to say about 
Open Source software, pass along the CFP to them and encourage them to 
apply.
