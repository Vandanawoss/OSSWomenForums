Subject: [Kde-women] KDE Perceived Software Quality Survey
Message-ID: <2020.130.85.90.164.1106347678.squirrel@130.85.90.164>

Dear KDE Users and Developers:

We are conducting empirical research on the quality and interface aspects
of various software. Therefore, we are investigating the perceived quality
of the KDE desktop software. For this purpose, we have created a short
survey. We would highly appreciate it if you could follow the link below
and fill out this survey:

The developers who use KDE during their daily computer operations can
respond too.

Many thanks for your help. Apologies if you received more than one copy.

Board of UMBC.
