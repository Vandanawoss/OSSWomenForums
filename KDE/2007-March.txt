Hello everybody,

today I want to address all people who would consider moderating this 
mailing list in the future. I'm moderating the list now for quite a while 
and have to say  that this task mainly consists of discarding spam messages. 
It doesn't take much time, but nonetheless it's not possible for me to 
continue doing that job. I always hoped that there would be more to moderate 
and that the list starts buzzing with life again. I still hope that this 
will happen someday.
I just got my diploma and I am going to start my new job soon, where I will 
be traveling a lot and won't have much time and won't have a constant 
internet connection. So this is a personal decision and I hope that someone 
interested in kde-women will take over this job.

Cheers,
Frauke

Hi Frauke,

Congrats with your diploma and your new job! Thank you for taking care of 
our mailinglist. I'm interested in taking over the job, so let me know 
whether/when I can get started. Is anyone else currenly moderating as 
well? 

All the best,

Claire

gosh, I'd forgotten this list existed :)
and I'll probably forget again, because all I have time for is school,
school and more school.

I've been on the list for a while now (at least a couple of years) 
and would consider moderating it when/if it picks up again. (Maybe 
with the release of KDE 4?)  I've moderated lists before, although 
it's been quite a while but I would consider it.

Cheers
Adrienne

It seems to me if I abhor intolerance, discrimination and hatred when 
they affect people who look like me, I must also abhor them when they 
affect people who do not.  (Leonard Pitts)

Subject: [Kde-women] Should we have a KDE Women Summer Outreach 2007 ?
Message-ID: <etr4e0$9as$1@sea.gmane.org>

Hello,

Last year Gnome had a nice idea to give some extra money to have a certain
number of grants for women doing Summer of Code projects.

http://www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/

Should we do the same ? Maybe we could get the same deal that Gnome had last
year. We put half of the money and Google the other half. 

My opinion is that a little push to increase our very low number of student
girls programming in KDE would be welcome.

Cheers,
Charles

Sorry all for the late answer...was busy with preparations.

I would like to give the list moderation to Claire and Vid. I think you two 
would make a great team. I will write you both soon privately with the 
necessary information.

Cheers,
Frauke
