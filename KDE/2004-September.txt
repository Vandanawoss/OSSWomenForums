Hi Claudia,

Thanks for your post. I take your email as a chance to present myself. I
am Bernhard, a social anthropologist, currently undertaking ethnographic
fieldwork in France. I am working for the University of Cambridge and I
do research in the realm of free software. 

I am on a EU funded project called flosspols. We try to figure out why
there are so few women in the free software world (all major surveys on
free software developers show that there are less than 2% women
involved) and what one could do to change the situation. In my project
team there are three more anthropologists (Dawn Nafus - specialised on
technology), James Leach (specialist in creativity and exchange theory)
and Marilyn Strathern (also working on exchange, author of the book 'The
gender of the gift'). 

My participation in the world of free software is not limited to online
groups (such as kde-women or linux chix), but I also engage in offline
events such as LUGs, conferences and camps. I get the impression that
there are more women in offline events than in online channels. Of
course this is hard to evaluate. I also have the impression that there
are more women involved in creative free software activities that are
not related to coding (such as design, advocacy, documentation,
translation,...). 

Cheers	,
--Bernhard

hm, for me the gesture includes the message: watch out, women, 
you're being watched :-)
and: you are so few...

well, while it may just be a nice transparent gesture of yours, i 
do not know the solution to the situation you've just placed 
yourself (and other list members) in - and i realise this is one 
reason why i definitely prefer patronising-free women-only 
lists :-)

you posing as an anthroplogist, can you help solve this situation 
- or may i suggest you rather let female colleagues of yours 
speak on this issue here?

what do others think about this?

and: can someone please try to explain to me why this list is so 
quiet?

best, Claudia

These are exactly the things I am interested in. Why is this a male
reaction? I would be curious to learn more about that.

Well, is this a 'women only' list? I did not assume that, especially
since there are public archives of the list. However if I was wrong I
very much apologise and will of course immediately un-subscribe. However
if the community would like to help me understand the situation of women
in free software I would be happy to stay and post questions from time
to time.

Unfortunately they are not involved in the fieldwork-part of the study.

actually, i personally have had enough of that kind of extra work 
(unpaid) and, to boot, find it tedious to explain to men all 
over again - so i am not the one to go into this - 

maybe someone else to promote current field research here - or 
rather by pm to bernard in case this is not a defined list 
focus?

> Well, is this a 'women only' list? 

it is marked as a women's list - which obviously in this case 
does not mean women only (just like in a swimming pool, maybe 
let's compare by substituting one gender for the other: if a 
changing room is maked "men" and a woman turns up to use the 
room, what do you think will happen?)

so in fact - right you are, aren't you - here is a nice terrain 
to discover (to put it colonially ;-) - and use - to find out 
how maybe also in open source communities the terrain - which 
terrain - is marked or unmarked and who respects unwritten rules 
and who doesn't see such rules at all and for what reasons 
terrain is marked and the like,

back to work,
cu, Claudia

Hi Bernhard,

In fact we cannot explain why there are few women in IT and/or free software 
as obviously we are involved in those. So such researches about women in IT 
should be conducted with women not involved.

Less than 2%: what about other technical fields as the Space Agency, some 
research fields and so on. Are these 2% such a special number?

do research in the realm of free software."

Hi Claudia,

I'm Frauke and maybe you know me from the mailinglists lynn and ada. I
worked some hard months very active on kde-women. Unfortunately I have
not much time to do so anymore.


>well, while it may just be a nice transparent gesture of yours, i

I personally think that kde-women is not(!) a women-only list and we
tried very hard to connect the work of kde-women with all other
developers and active people in KDE. We don't want to be a seperated
group of women, but want to be integrated in the whole KDE community.
This list and this project should help women to become a member of the
KDE community and to become active in the project. So I will welcome
every man, who is interested in the kde-women project. So welcome
Bernhard!

>and: can someone please try to explain to me why this list is so 
>quiet?

Well this list is very quiet, because the project is sleeping again.
Every post on the list is welcome, so I hope to read more posts here
again.

Cheers,
Frauke

well, then my choice would be to refrain from gendered talk 
altogether (hello Bernhard ;-) 
hello Claudia: - had I not trodden into feeling provoked ;-)

let's talk shop then, about KDE, and try to do away with the 
boundaries that seem to separate one part of the KDE-community 
from another...

Hi all,

Thanks for your answers. I am very happy to feel welcomed. 

Anne-Marie, you are of course right, research on the issue should not
only be done with the women involved. I do not think that women are the
reason why free software is such a gendered community. Most time I spend
in settings that are not determined by or for women. Observations I made
in forums like slashdot, for instance, give me some ideas why free
software appears not be very attractive for women (I guess most of you
are familiar with comments on gender issues there). 

However the things I learned being in contact with women's groups such
as linuxchix were very helpful. Participants there pointed me to
interesting sources of information (such as literature, howtos, etc).
Furthermore I am interested in whether and how channels that are set up
by women could help to increase female participation in free software. 

> Less than 2%: what about other technical fields as the Space Agency, some 
> research fields and so on. Are these 2% such a special number?

There are of course fields (even if very few) where one finds such low
female participation. Studies of women in science for instance have
interesting approaches for explanation. However, what I think is
intruiging in the case of free software, is the fact that there seem to
be more women in proprietary software than in open source. 

> link please? 

Thanks Brendan, we will of course put up the findings there. 

Cheers,

Hello!

To comment very briefly on the women in OSS movement, my guess would be 
economic. It's harder for us to get jobs that pay as well as men - and often 
we are still expected to be homemakers as well. So if the choice is between 
working unwaged on open source software or be paid to work on proprietary 
software, it may be no real choice at all for many. 

I havent had a chance to look at the KDE development stuff in Linux as yet, 
because I've needed to start learning SQL in a hurry. But I hope to take a 
look at it soon.

Hi,

There are more women that thought at first sight in KDE.
I discovered another one today, in fact I was intrigued because I thought 
'this person behaves as I do' (in the way she is involved in the project) but 
I did not think at first she was a woman. When I found out, I was pleased and 
it stresses your point, Bernhard, about women doing things differently and 
being more involved. I remarked (and was told) that women have a better sense 
of the community dimension in the project. I also remark they tend to pursue 
their objective until it's done while men would jump from 1 to another.
Women also abstain of quick flaming people.
That's only general comments and only my opinion.

Maybe a study will find that women in general are more involved in 'free' 
activities in the society, helping at schools, involved in charities and so 
on (free as they give and don't get anything in return). It's my opinion that 
women give a lot of free time to others so it's just a matter of defining 
Open a bit more maybe :-)

That was just some quick thoughts,

Anne-Marie

Esp. since it prevents us from being more involved in the technical side... 
there are too many of those studies taking place lately... and as we don't 
have enough women for that the researchers aks the same women over and over 
again ;-)

BTW: it seems people not involved with free software like the term foss or 
floss - I don't understand why. It stands for
free, libre and open source software - which is actually the same. It's like 
calling apples "apples pommes and ?pfel"...

In my experience the usage of this term hasn't anything to do with whether  
people are involved in Open Source projects or not -- to me it looks more  
like a regional term: It isn't used much in Europe, but when talking with  
Open Source people from developing countries, I come quite frequently  
around it. Which, of course, doesn't render your statement about the  
pleonasm invalid.

testing this list for my inquiries proves that i opt for a 
different forum to place my KDE inquiries in, cu there,

i will stay on here and see how the feel develops
(hi bernard, this is a test result for your research :-)

Hi there,

sorry for responding that late. I was offline for a couple of days.

Anne-Marie, I think this is very interesting. Originally I thought that
women would involve in different activities than men would do (for
instance women would do more internationalisation than coding). However
now I understand your post in the sense that women have a different
approach within the same kind of activity (e.g. women would code
differently, stay longer with a problem, etc).

When you were intereacting with this other developer, what in particular
was it that it made you think 'this person behaves as I do'? I mean was
something like similarly commenting code or reacting to criticism? Has
anybody else made similar experienes?

Thanks. 

Cheers,

Ps: In the FLOSS project in 2001/2 we invented the term to escape
discussions at that time whether one should call non-proprietary
software 'free software', 'open source' or 'libre software'. We wanted
everybody who took part of one of the 'communities'. I personally do not
make a difference in these terms. Results within the survey also showed
that there were not many significant differences between people of the
different communities.

In the way she pursues the common objective, in the way she explains her views 
and not dismiss gratuitously some ideas and so on. In the way she interacts 
with people (via emails). Names don't make it evident what gender a person is 
so there was no clue for me she was female other than I had a feeling after a 
few shared work that she was.
And I don't know how she came to KDE but it is as easier for a woman than for 
a man to do any work in KDE. The only difficulty might be on IRC when you 
state you're a woman and some people might act as jerks. IRC anonymity might 
reinforce that. Handling it is not difficult though (ain't I known as 'KDE 
Mum'? ;-)
