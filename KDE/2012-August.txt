I hope not G+ or anything like that.  IRC works quite well, why rock
the boat with new and hard to use and not available to everyone stuff?

There is a number of good reasons for that. IRC does not allow the
same mean of interaction and flexibility, especially when it comes to
sharing screens or showing stuff in a whiteboard. Also, speaking in
person in much faster and allows for more detailing. Last but not
least, I don't really understand the point of availability and "new
and hard to use".

In general, G+ hangouts or $conferencesolution is what gets closer to
a real "classroom", and people were happy about it, modulo the fact of
the limit of the followers. Now that the technology has evolved I see
close to no reason for not using it.

In addition to what Dario said: We want to reach a new audience. For
them IRC isn't necessarily easier than Google Hangout. IRC is easy for
us - but we're looking to expand our reach. You need to pick up people
where they are.


Cheers

Subject: [Kde-women] Input for talk?
Message-ID: <CAA0Jy_w1nTaH1bBwKYd_VdA+ySuc_5+SuK=S9eK0trbV=1eCRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm hosting a short session at http://geekgirlmeetup.de/ on September
15th. I will recycle my talk from FSCONS last year, on how to organize
and run successful sprints [1], but since I assume that not everyone
in the audience will be a developer or contributor to a FLOSS project,
I want to put a bit of a different twist to the talk - something like
"why should you organise a meeting/sprint" and how you can pull it off
easily.

Do any of you have some input for this? Maybe also something
especially from a female perspective?

Thanks,
Claudia
