Hi,

I thought I would write, as I haven't had an mail through 
on the mailing list!!

Well, an Introduction is that I am a 19 year old female 
from the UK, who as been interested in Linux since I was 
17.

I am at the moment concentrating on several projects, the 
first is my PHP and Mysql skills, the second is learning 
to program in C (I haven't yet found an answer to wheather 
or not I'm too old to start learning!! Everyone seems like 
they are 14 year old boys!!), and a website that I hope to 
get up and running soon about Open Source in Schools 
around the world to show people it can be done!!!

I am at the moment a Technician in a secondary school in 
Kent, which I'm afraid doesn't use Linux, though the last 
2 schools I worked at did!! Plus my partner Paul is also 
spreading the word by having Linux server etc at the 
school he works at too.

Sorry if this has bored everyone, if its quiet because 
I've set my communigate pro rules wrong please let me 
know....urmmm...somehow!!

Jo

ps. I did run Mandrake 10, but due to lack of functions 
went back to M9.2.....miss KDE 3.2 now!!!

pps. I would like to help with a project like KDE but feel 
that I lack the programming skills (hence the studying!) 
what would I need to learn, and is there anything I could 
do in the mean time??

Hey, you just remembered me of something. I'll send a second mail about 
it later :)

the second is learning to program in C (I haven't

I would like to answer your question, because I am 20 and I started to 
learn C++ a year ago. I have to say that I wasn't really good in 
learning it from books, but now I study computer science at uni and I 
just learned how to code in C. So, if I can manage to learn something 
like that you will make it too. It's true that there are a lot of 14 
year old boys learning C / C++, but there are also some women who start 
to learn C. I know another woman, who is at our age and she just started 
to learn C too. So, I think you really should go ahead with learning.

and a website that I

Why should it bore everyone? I think it is quiet good to introduce 
oneself to the mailinglist, so we know you are here ;-)

Ok, if you want to start contributing by coding in KDE, you should learn 
C++. Most of the code in KDE is written in C++. But there is also the 
possibility in coding in other languages, because there are language 
bindings in KDE available. You also can have a look at Qt, the toolkit 
that is used by KDE. If you want to read a tutorial about Coding for KDE 
you can have a look at our website. Annma wrote some nice tutorials. 
You'll find them under http://women.kde.org/articles/
In the mean time there is a lot to do. You can help developing our 
website or write articles for it. You can also contribute to KDE in 
other ways. The newest possibility is the KDE Quality Team, if I get 
that right. You can also work together with our male supporters and help 
for example to improve Usability. It isn't a question of what tasks has 
to be done, because there are enough, believe me, but a question about 
what are you interested in?

If you have any questions, just go ahead and ask. And again welcome to 
KDE Women!

Hi!
As I wrote in my last mail, I was reminded of something and I badly need 
help with it. Some time ago I wrote that I want to setup a database for 
the website to handle tasks, that need to be done. Unfortunately I have 
no time to work hard on it and my first attempt to create the database 
was completely rubbish. So I am searching for someone who knows Mysql 
and maybe php too. Anyone who is interested in writing the database, 
please help me!

Cheers,

thanks for the friendly response....I know my anti-spam is 
working now!!!

Talking about MySQL and PHP have you tried PHP-Nuke? I 
have used it a many a time re-wrote it to my own 
advantage...eg. using the content page for teachers to 
post homework online (for students and parents sake) they 
might have something that you can change... though saying 
that after about 3 months I have "grown out" of that and 
and have started to php and mysql mysql myself....but for 
a quick answer it might be worth looking.

I learned C at 20+, and C++ at 30.  I don't see age as a problem.

Same for me. I did some basic and pascal in school, but today I wouldn't 
regard that as real programming. I started learning C/C++ when I was 25, but 
my main learning period was when I did a real large-scale project with 27+. I 
learned all the things that can go wrong ;-) Today I'd say that 
object-oriented programming like in C++ helps more against these faults than 
structured programming in C. 
I don't think age matters and my experience is, that 14 year old boys often 
want to show off themselves and that they can talk a lot of rubbish ;-) What 
really matters is, that you don't only study books but do real projects.

Welcome to the project :-)

Talking about learning... I've been looking for evening courses like crazy and found nothing. No programming courses (unless you want to go back to uni and become engineer), no unix or linux courses. I even posted messages on the Brussels Linux message list and no one could tell where I could follow a unix or linux course??? The only thing I can find is expensive courses like red hat certification which must be 400 € for a 3 day course and you have to know the basics already...
Any idea on how to learn programming when you're working all day and don't have much money??? ;-)

Just buy a book or study some online tutorials. You'll find some sample code 
to try. Then try your hands on a real project when you have the basics. Then 
you'll be able to learn deeper.
I began with some online C++ tutorials and now I have 5 C++ books plus 2 
Design Patterns books! (well, I love books...) I bring a C++ book while my 
daughter is having her ice-skating lesson for example.
Each time I come to something new in C++, I try to read about it. I also 
understand better things that I have learnt at the beginning. But I would say 
that after 3 years, I am still a beginner...

Maybe I could write a webpage on the women.kde.org with a sort of 'guideline' 
on learning C++/Qt/KDE
- online C++ tutorials
- online Qt tutorials
- annma's tutorial ;)
- try it yourself! and use: Qt doc and KDE API doc

The incredible fact is that everything is possible in Open Source, whatever 
gender, country and ... age ;)

Latest  website news:
1) Marina translated some tutorials to Russian, thanks!
2) Did you read the article Tuxy wrote on the website about Kalzium? If anyone 
feels like writing something about a KDE application or anything else related 
to Free Software, please do it and either send me the html or go further and 
use cvs yourself to put it online (I'll guide you)!
3) Someone with php/mySQL knowledge is needed to carry on the database 
project.

Cheers,

annma

What exactly is needed to be done? How time-consuming will it be? I 
might be able to contribute, but I need some more information!

I only can say that it is very important to practice programming. I read
some books about C++ before I started to study computer science at uni and
books can only teach you the syntax. To get the real understanding for the
programming language you have to practice it. I would give you the advice to
use books that give you coding tasks, so that you can practice using the
syntax. At my uni I get every week a coding task and it really helped me to
get better and to understand what I am doing. So just try to find a way for
practicing.

If you need any advice I guess you'll find it at this mailing list.

Cheers,
Frauke

Hello Frauke,

I just returned from vacation and while catching up with email found 
this one. I can help, I have been working as a database 
administrator/programmer/designer for almost 4 years to the date on 
multiple architectures. Are you free to chat some of these days?
Take care,

I explained the main idea of the database in a mail some time ago. Maybe you
read this as a first step.
http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-women&m=106987214831803&w=2

The database should contain some tables, one for information about the task
that need to be done, one for personal information about the person who
assigned to the task and there should be a table that consists information
about the level of the task and some other details about the task.

So, what is needed to be done, is to write this database with Mysql and to
write a webinterface for the database. The webinterface should include a
search function (application, level, or something else), read through the
task description, a formula for the assignment or background questions and
so on.

If the database is ready and the webinterface, one of the guys will put the
database on our server, so the database can be used by everyone who wants to
contribute to KDE and searches a task that needs to be done.

Any volunteer for the job to write the database??

I will now go online in the IRC, if someone wants to talk about it, just
join the channel.

Cheers,
Frauke

Hello :)
I have been a long time in your case... Wanting even to change job and working in computing... So I did it with books I baught... But at the end I got internet and learned everything with tutorials... At the age of 50y after waiting 25y I endly got the chance in France to get a training as Analyst ! 
But great deception : No much programming and old methods... i  found a job six years ago as analyst but I had a lot of work to train myself to a better level !!!
Now I soon in "retirement"... And just learned it won't be well paid ! As it should have been... Well doesn't matter : I just started to learn "POV-RAY" to be able to write a theory in maths and physics I am seeking for years !!!
So if you have internet and know english they are so many good tutorials than can make you a real good one, with patience and work :)
Kde-women is a good start : kdevelop will help you... I think what you have to do is in which "domain" you want to programm, and which language... c /c++, basic etc...
There is a good BASIC like visual basic on linux : http://gambas.sourceforge.net... And start ! Examples are many and working !!!
kdevelop too and kde apps... with gnome : glade (http://www.gtk.org) and follow glade links... http://anjuta.sourceforge.net an IDE ...
And if you speak french : Go to http://www.developpez.com...
You have all things from beginners to advanced programming : You can even be in a list or go in forum ... For linux you can get fedora or mandrake which are quite easy to install... And if you want more precise details, send me an email and I will see how i can help you... Communauty is a great family and when one is newbie.. (i am always newbie... lol.. Because there is so much to learn !! ) just ask for help... And be patient ! Some people are very nice other less.. But don't worry : Just tell them nicely they aren't very nice and usually they apologize !!! If there are gentleman or lady !!!
wish you good luck :)
Henri

Hi everybody,
I just talked to Frauke on IRC. I'm also interested in working on this
database-project, but the next 2 months I won't have much time as the
winter term is nearly over and examination time starts - so lot of work
for me and less free time.

Our idea was to have a meeting on IRC with all women, who are interested
in working on this project, maybe at the weekend (Jan 31/Feb 1) as this
is maybe faster and more effective than discussing on the list.

I have made a little ER-diagram about how the database could look like -
have a look at http://www.missmarple-net.de/kde-women/tasks_db.png
(sorry, this is a quick'n'dirty-dia-hack)

OK, enough said, cu

Katrin

Hi everybody,
just wanted to ask who of you will visit the Linux-Day in
Chemnitz/Germany at March 6/7.
I will be there both days, so maybe we can meet there - I really like to
get to know you in real life (as I just joined the project and don't
know anyone of you in real life).

CU, Katrin

I'm a bit unavailable this weekend ... any chance we can chat during the 
week?

Hi Ines,
very nice diagram - I guess now I understood more the thing it is all
about ;-) (BTW: What tool do you use to draw your diagrams?)
Well we can also chat during the week, the suggestion to chat on the
weekend was made with the intention that you might have more time on
weekends. Maybe we wait for some more responses of the others and then
agree upon a date.

Hello Katrin,

The diagram is not even close to finished that's why we need to chat 
about it (I'm sure tons of other attributes will show up). To draw my 
diagrams I use a database CASE called ERWIN that also writes the DDL 
statements that make up the entities.
Looking forward to talking with you all,

Ines

Hi Katrin,

you may want to contact Tobias Koenig who is in Chemnitz. He'll probably also 
run the KDE booth there, so if you want, he'll surely be thankful if you 
could help him (and the others who are there). His email address is 
tokoe@kde.org.

Welcome to KDE, BTW :)) You certainly did the right thing :)

Hello :)
I have been a long time in your case... Wanting even to change job and working in computing... So I did it with books I baught... But at the end I got internet and learned everything with tutorials... At the age of 50y after waiting 25y I endly got the chance in France to get a training as Analyst ! 
But great deception : No much programming and old methods... i  found a job six years ago as analyst but I had a lot of work to train myself to a better level !!!
Now I soon in "retirement"... And just learned it won't be well paid ! As it should have been... Well doesn't matter : I just started to learn "POV-RAY" to be able to write a theory in maths and physics I am seeking for years !!!
So if you have internet and know english they are so many good tutorials than can make you a real good one, with patience and work :)
Kde-women is a good start : kdevelop will help you... I think what you have to do is in which "domain" you want to programm, and which language... c /c++, basic etc...
There is a good BASIC like visual basic on linux : http://gambas.sourceforge.net... And start ! Examples are many and working !!!
kdevelop too and kde apps... with gnome : glade (http://www.gtk.org) and follow glade links... http://anjuta.sourceforge.net an IDE ...
And if you speak french : Go to http://www.developpez.com...
You have all things from beginners to advanced programming : You can even be in a list or go in forum ... For linux you can get fedora or mandrake which are quite easy to install... And if you want more precise details, send me an email and I will see how i can help you... Communauty is a great family and when one is newbie.. (i am always newbie... lol.. Because there is so much to learn !! ) just ask for help... And be patient ! Some people are very nice other less.. But don't worry : Just tell them nicely they aren't very nice and usually they apologize !!! If there are gentleman or lady !!!
wish you good luck :)
Henri

  Talking about learning... I've been looking for evening courses like crazy and found nothing. No programming courses (unless you want to go back to uni and become engineer), no unix or linux courses. I even posted messages on the Brussels Linux message list and no one could tell where I could follow a unix or linux course??? The only thing I can find is expensive courses like red hat certification which must be 400 ? for a 3 day course and you have to know the basics already...
  Any idea on how to learn programming when you're working all day and don't have much money??? ;-)

  Same for me. I did some basic and pascal in school, but today I wouldn't 
  regard that as real programming. I started learning C/C++ when I was 25, but 
  my main learning period was when I did a real large-scale project with 27+. I 
  learned all the things that can go wrong ;-) Today I'd say that 
  object-oriented programming like in C++ helps more against these faults than 
  structured programming in C. 
  I don't think age matt! ers and my experience is, that 14 year old boys often 
  want to show off themselves and that they can talk a lot of rubbish ;-) What 
  really matters is, that you don't only study books but do real projects.

  Welcome to the project :-)
