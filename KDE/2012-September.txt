No ideas? Or any hints as to what *you* would find interesting? My
current thinking is now along the lines of "what can you learn from
FLOSS communities" and tie that to events. Any input would be
appreciated :)

Hey :)

Here's a few things that come to my mind right now:
* you get to know people
* people get to know you
* it's a task that developers are usually thrilled about someone else
taking it -> they will love you
* you learn a lot about organizing and planning
* it's one way to give back to Free Software in an essential way
without writing code
* you get to show your city/country to a bunch of awesome people from abroad
* language skills++
* people skills++

Cheers
Lydia

Hi People,

What do you think about we start to promote it?
Aracele: you could write about it.

For this would be nice more tutorials in the spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al1cWa29jR2idC1HRFZEZ2hSWkJjWGdJeHptTnRNWXc#gid=0

I've decided to change mine to something easier: How easy is to
develop a plasmoide (with qml and plasmate)
what do you think?

Even if we don't have exactly the title of the tutorials, we could at
least tell people that we are planing to do something October 16th.
And if the tutorials are not too long we could start at 5:00 pm UTC
time, what do you think?

Cheers,
Camila Ayres

well I know I'd be interested in hearing about how to make a women in
stem (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) group in a town
or at a school.  I've not had any success in getting one started but
seeing as out of the 18 credits I'm taking this semester in over half
I'm the only woman (3 classes), the the other 2 have a grand total of
3 other women (2 and 1).  So it might be that there aren't enough
bodies to make my idea work where I am.

Yeah, I can imagine that this isn't easy. Here in Berlin there quite a
big start-up scene and women in tech is kind of a hype topic right now
;).

How did you promote you group? Did you reach out to the local LUG (if
there is one) or did you talk to your teachers? Maybe they can share
this?

Well Claudia,

I talked to my advisor, who happens to be the Computer Department
Chair, and the advisor for the computer club.  He didn't see the need
for a women in STEM group since there was a computer club.  The few
programming instructors I talked to (because there is only like 3
total in the school) didn't have any interest in becoming an advisor.
I didn't ask anyone in the Science or Math departments as I'm not a
student in any of those programs and didn't know whom to approach.
The school didn't like the idea of it as it wasn't co-ed, and yet they
have a group for black men.  This is my last semester and then
hopefully I'll get accepted to a halfway decent school to continue my
education.

I also put up some flyers and held a couple interest meetings where I
was the only one that showed up.  And yet, in my basic electronic
class (AC/DC circuits) the 2 other women come to me to help them as I
obviously know what I'm doing.

As for a LUG there isn't one in town, I don't think there is one in
the entire state!  In my linux class (which I couldn't test out of so
I have to take it), no one else likes or uses linux including the
instructor, and she doesn't like kde and is like don't use it use
gnome!  Then again she is a mac person.

I think its the fact that in america few want to help until they need help.

Wow, this must be frustrating... and the reaction of your teacher
clearly show why there is a need for a women's group. I think it's
great that you tried to organize something.

I hope you get the chance to go to a Linuxfest in your area some time.
Since I'm not based in the US, I can't really offer any suggestions.
But maybe Valorie, who should be on this list, too, can offer some
advice.

Sometimes going through the student government channels works better
than directly with teaching staff. Other resources are the student
services folks, or the librarians. Good people to know, whether or not
they can help. And sometimes librarians are the BEST advisors. They
know everyone, and everything.

Sounds familiar. How about meeting in a pub or cool restaurant?
Sometimes people want to get away from campus.

I think you are right, but women do like to network with other smart
women. Perhaps you just need to widen your focus a bit? If women
aren't interested in help/support, perhaps they are interested in fun
activities, networking, learning new skills, etc.

Also what can work (see OpenHatch) is opening it up to men if they are
brought by women.

And yes, a thousand times yes to attending a Linux Festival somewhere
within your area. Our local Linuxfest Northwest is *awesome.* I hear
good things about the SELF, OLF and SCaLE too.

Coming Friday.
By Wednesday we should have all tutorials in the spreadsheet. So far
we have only 3. This isn't a lot... We should have at least one or two
more.
I just added a general Q&A session that I am going to do together with Frederik.

> Aracele: you could write about it.

That'd be great. Make sure it is clear that this is for women and
their friends. Everyone is welcome as long as they're nice.
We should have more than one. I will try to blog the Monday after
next. Who else? We should spread it out. Anyone up for drafting a dot
story that we can publish 4 days before the event?

Hi everybody!

As I had said I can write something to spread around. Is there a deadline
for this?
I can help to write the dot story too.
There is someone else here in Brazil who will make a tutorial. Her name is
Melissa.
Maybe her tutorial is about kile and LaTex. I added her to this list.

Cheers.

I'd be great if you could do it on Friday. (Not before Wednesday.
Hopefully until then we'll have 1 or 2 more tutorials.)

Great! https://promo.notes.kde.org/81 is the place for it. The password is ada.

I agree that his answer was iffy at best, but the computer club barely
has enough members at the start of each year to keep going.  I'm
currently going to a small public school on my own dime, (US slang for
I'm paying for in this case, my schooling without any assistance) so
its not surprising that its hard to get enough people to start let
alone maintain a school club, especially one aimed at a minority that
the government doesn't feel a need to help.  There is a club on campus
that is restricted to minority males and gets government money however,
if I were to start one it would have to open to the guys.  Thinking about it,
I don't think that should be much of a problem, just add that disrespectful
guys will be asked to behave, second offense to leave, be asked to leave
twice or refuse to once asked, call the campus police, have them escorted
out and banned for their disrespectful behaviour.  The school is big on the
respect thing, which I like, I don't see it from everyone but from
enough to know
that more are then aren't.

I'm going to try and get one going if I end up going to a co-ed school
for my higher education otherwise I'll be going to an all women's
college were I don't think it would be as hard to start and maintain a
group of women supporting each other.  Which was my basic idea,
support each other to learn the material and deal with any shall we
say any attitutes that we may encounter along the way.  I did visit the
student orgization advisor and got some info on club rules.  I'm thinking
perhaps having a few info sessions to see what sort of interest there is and
see if any of the instructors in other departments would be willing to
advertise,
such as the math, nursing, computer, physcis, chem, and artiecture departments.

ON a happier note, there is a Regional LinuxFest in a city around 3-4
hours from my door to the confrence center's doors.  They are meeting
next June, of which companies such as google, hp, and oracle were
sponsors last year.  Plus KDE was there.  Sadly there isn't any information
the cost of attending like what the rooms cost last year, or the enterance fee.
So I'll be checking in on the website as often as I can remember to,
until I find
out.
