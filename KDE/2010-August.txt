Subject: [Kde-women] Free software booth at Grace Hopper
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=hBEkM7=YD9xLr6M7oz=w6EnKKPY=Eoj6+Wq=M@mail.gmail.com>

Hi KDE Women,

We have a booth to represent free and open source software at Grace
Hopper[1] this year!

If you will be there and are willing to help out, even if only for a few
hours, please let me know! You don't have to be an expert, just willing to
talk about free software, your experience, and point people in the right
direction.

If you won't be there, but have some stickers or handouts about your project
that you'd be willing to send, we'd love to have them!

A bit of history: I noticed that there were lots of company booths at Grace
Hopper but no booths where women could go ask about free software and while
some of the companies that work with free software were represented, none of
the free software projects had a booth. So I asked, and Grace Hopper
generously gave us a free booth.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Stormy

Hi Stormy :)

Thanks for asking.
I have not heard of anyone of us going to GH this year unfortunately.
But maybe Claudia can send a few stickers and flyers to you to hand
out.


Cheers
Lydia
