Hi all,

Just quickly wanted to share two articles that I found quite
interesting. The second one is an essay/answer to the first one, so if
you want to read them, read the article by Joseph Reagle first.

1) http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4291/3381

2) http://geekfeminism.org/2013/02/04/open-source-closed-minds-a-reflection-on-joseph-reagles-free-as-in-sexist-free-culture-and-the-gender-gap/

Before reading these articles:

FOSDEM has a larger (perceived by me, anyway) proportion of women attending 
than any other Free Software conference I've been at. People also bring their 
kids.

There were two talks at FOSDEM about culture and community which I didn't see 
but I'm told were good and inspiring: Leslie Hawthorn's talk and another 
called "Assholes are killing your project". Might be worth following up with 
the recordings of those two.

Yes, that was my impression, too, in previous years. FOSDEM is
somewhat different from Akademy, though. Much larger, many, many
different projects, not just one.  I still wonder how we can reach out
to get more women involved with KDE.

Thanks for the tips, will take a look at those.

Hi all,

You are probably aware of Akademy 2013 [1] in July in Bilbao, Spain.
At last year's Akademy, we had a Women's Bof. In that session, we
discussed a few ideas about how we can make KDE more attractive to
female contributors - see my mail to this list from 19 July 2012.

One of those ideas was to organise a women's get-together during
Akademy and/or plan a women's track/ conference day. Example was: the
women's miniconf during linuxconf.au.

Are people on this list interested in organising one or the other?
What are your ideas for Akademy? The local team in Bilbao also has
contacts to local female Free Software activists so we could work with
them.

Cheers,
Claudia

Hi all,

March 8 is International Women's Day. Shall we all blog again? Or does
somebody have a better idea?
