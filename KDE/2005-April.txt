Hi,

My name is Claire and I'm part of the Dutch KDE team. I was wondering about 
the job database that you mention on http://women.kde.org/projects/ . Will it 
be a framework that is available for translation teams as well? I just picked 
up writing a static page with tasks again, and am actually looking for a 
better maintainable solution. Could you provide me with some more 
information? Thanks in advance.

Regards,

Claire

For various reasons, I haven't been able to start looking into modern 
programming yet (and I'm now rying to work my way through LPI certification), 
but if anyone here could use some help in either translating into English or 
proofreading (British)  English docfiles or localisation stuff, just give me 
a yell, I'd be happy to help if I can.

Hi Claire,

Sorry for answering late! The job database was meant to be with SQL and php 
which was difficult to set up anyway. The database was never set up as the 
Quality Team had the same sort of idea at the same time.
In fact we should have carried our idea because the Quality Team 'deflated' 
after a big start...
So I'm afraid I cannot help you here.

Regards,

Anne-Marie

Hello Anne,

I was the one supposed to build it but never got any answers and then 
Frauke left. Is the project db still needed?
I am still willing to help.

As for me, unfortunately I have little time for that at the moment. I don't 
remember the details for it. If you're willing to help, maybe we can rebuild 
a team to work on it. First mails about that should be looked at in the 
archives. Roughly I think we wanted to record all tasks that have to be done 
and try to get somebody for them. Like 'review this handbook to check 
English', 'this app needs help' and so on.

Dear all,

In the framework of the flosspols project we currently run a survey which 
focuses on the aspect of learning as well as the role/situation of women 
within the free/libre/open source software community (see announcment 
below). We are interested in the opinion of all kinds of contributors 
(developers, translators, documentors, promotor, etc.).

http://flosspols.org/survey/survey_part.php?groupid=blkkdw

It would be great if you could help us by (a) filling in the survey and (b) 
by forwarding it to people you know in the community. Up until now our 
sample contains around 3.5% women (which is about twice as much as female 
participants in floss). It would be great if we could include even more 
women, also to be able to carry out more reliable statistical analysis.

Thanks for your attention and for considering your support.

Best,
Bernhard


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear FLOSS (Free / Libre / Open Source Software) participant:

In 2002, MERIT/Infonomics at the University of Maastricht, the Netherlands, 
carried out the FLOSS developer survey supported by the European Union. 
This was the first survey that provided deep insights in the international 
FLOSS community, its divisions, its diversity of beliefs, and its 
functioning. Although this study has been pathbreaking for many research 
activities in the following years, some very important questions regarding 
this phenomenon remained unanswered so far.

The original FLOSS survey sponsored by the European Union, and follow up 
FLOSS-US (Stanford) and FLOSS-Japan/FLOSS-Asia (Mitsubishi Research) showed 
that "Learning new skills" was the most common reason provided by 
participants for their FLOSS activities. Another significant finding of 
surveys is that there are far fewer women in FLOSS development than in 
software development as a whole. In this two-part survey, once again 
supported by the European Union, we would like to find out, first, how 
learning is organised and perceived within the FLOSS community - by which 
we mean the universe of all those who participate in FLOSS-related 
activities, regardless of their beliefs or degree of activity. We also want 
to understand better the role/situation of women within this broad 
community.

For this purpose we rely heavily on your support, because you and your 
colleagues are the only ones who have the experience and expertise to help 
us revealing a realistic and appropriate picture of the community. 
Therefore we would like to ask you to fill in the following 
questionnaire.The more FLOSS participants - not only developers - respond, 
the better and more accurate the survey results.

FLOSSPOLS is a scientific project that is financed by the European 
Commission. It serves exclusively purposes in the public interest, 
especially the provision of support for European policies towards Open 
Source and Free Software. The information you provide will be kept strictly 
confidential, and nobody outside the FLOSSPOLS research team will have 
access to personalised data. Moreover, all results we publish will ensure 
that the identification of persons who have replied to the questionnaires 
will be impossible. The FLOSSPOLS Team is cooperating with the Stanford 
NSF-funded project that conducted the FLOSS-US survey on questionnaire 
design, to minimise the number of questionnaires sent to participants.

If you are younger than 18 years, we would like to draw attention to the 
fact that surveying of underage persons is a sensitive ethical issue in the 
EU framework. However, we acknowledge that many members of the FLOSS 
community are quite young. If you are underage, we would like to recommend 
that you carefully consider the purpose of our survey, as stated in this 
letter, before filling it out.

If you have further questions or comments on this topic do not hesitate to 
contact us (email: dev_survey@flosspols.org).

Thank you for your support.

The FLOSSPOLS Research Team

I didn't like this idea then, and I hate it now.  Duplicating an insufficient  
resource with an unmaintained one, instead of working on improving the 
existing one, seems like a complete waste of time to me.

There is a jobs page on www.kde.org for open jobs - this page sees a lot of 
traffic.  There is the quality team, which I beg to differ, hasn't actually 
deflated as much as you might think, although the attempts to manage this 
exact information mentioned above didn't come to much.  Why might that be? 
Because it's a MASSIVE job to maintain, and nobody has time to do it.  In a 
wiki, in a text file, or in a DB, it doesn't matter, unless you grow everyone 
another 24 hours in a day.   

The logical thing to do is to put recurring/ongoing jobs on the jobs page, and 
leverage bugs.kde.org the way the docs team (and others, notably the PIM team 
and the Quality team) have. We use the junior jobs, and generally filing lots 
of small bitesize tasks as bugs and marking them so, feels like a much more 
practical way forward.  It's been easily the most productive decision we 
made: Open jobs are either bugs or wishlist items, and should be filed 
*anyway*, bugzilla is already set up to deal with exactly this.

[See http://i18n.kde.org/doc/current.php for links to pre-rolled queries to 
pull out the beginner docs jobs from bugzilla, for instance, or the PIM team 
doing exactly the same thing: http://pim.kde.org/development/bugs.php )

Hi Lauri,

I see your point. However the Quality Team failed to turn with any productive 
idea and last time I looked at the Junior Jobs bugs (I thought I could work 
on some) I was appealed. One was to port KMail to KConfig XT (89446). How 
Junior is that, I am not sure ;-)

Anyway it's all too complicated ad of course a database needs huge work.

For those who want to be involved in doing something, I suggest that the first 
task would be to update women.kde.org and to think of new ideas to keep it 
going.

Regards,

Anne-Marie

Hi Anne-Marie, 

Sorry about that. I did not make this point clear enough. Obviously the 
results of the survey will be published. All results and policy 
recommendation coming out of the flosspols project will be made public. We 
will even provide the anonymised raw data of the survey after the project 
is over. Additionally at the end of the questionnaire the survey 
participants have the possibility to enter their email address so that they 
will be informed individually about the survey results.

It is one aim of the flosspols project to provide an understanding of why 
there are so few women involved in free/libre/open source software (less 
than 2%) and to reccmmend measures to counteract this trend. So it would be 
of real help if you could support this survey.

Hopefully this clears your concerns. 

Thanks,
Bernhard

I still don't see how the study of the extraordinary women who are already
participating can give information why the majority are not participating.
Studying Margaret Thatcher won't give you much clue about the common
British woman.

My opinion after having a very minor role in the project for some 5 years,
is that the number of women will naturally increase as KDE becomes more
mainstream. What is hindering is the present volunteer pattern in Free
Software Project. Generally, you have a young man who will one day convert
to KDE, spend all his time and energy coding and sending zillions of
e-mails, then burn-out and leave. KDE (and other projects) have a very good
structure to capture the energy of generations of shooting stars. I think
that most women would be more interested in participation without full
conversion where they can volunteer time and work but keep other interests
and hobbies.

My point of comparison is roller-skating. When I was young in France,
roller-skating was a pure male activity. As a young teenager, you would
convert to roller skating, change your clothes, gather in small groups on
the specific spots in the city and practice for hours difficult figures
like a rat in a cage. There were some girls in the skater community but
they were a tiny minority. Today, roller-skating is mainstream, people do
it every Sundays with your friends or family and the sex ratio has become
standard. I believe this kind of mutation will happen also for Free
Software projects.

That is why it is maybe interesting to have a page describing jobs that you
can do in the KDE project that will fit your free time. Recruiting
volunteers is a very frustrating job. A lot of people will send an e-mail
and ask for information and then leave without going further. But, you have
to do it. By the way, I'm looking for somebody to help (and quickly take
the responsability) of doing promotional work for KDE in France. No need of
any technical expertise. It is a 2 hours / week job.   

Cheers,
Charles

Excellent analysis! Yes, more and more women join the project and become KDE 
users. I meet some on IRC.

And yes, I'm not Margaret Thatcher and I roller skate!

To stay in line with your analogy, it would make sense to look into 
biographies of female politicians in the UK in the 1970s/1980s to find out 
which kind of women get into politics in the first place. It is further 
interesting to talk to politicians (female and male) to see whether they 
have different perceptions of what is actually happening in parliament, in 
the lobbies, in the clubs, etc. Looking at the kind of politcs they stand 
for, the kind of parties they join and the ways how they persue their goals 
may reveal a lot of what is happening in politics as well as in the society 
in general that keeps women out of politics.

Having said that I would rather not compare female free software 
participants with Maggie Thatcher ;)

Actually I would hope that the ratio of the female skaters which perform 
difficult figures would increase as well. Isn?t it important for free 
software that more women get in before the mainstream? Why do they wait 
that long?

Unfortunately I am no longer in France (which also means that I cannot join

Is there more activity on IRC for KDE women?

I hope so, at least for your first claim.

And if you start penetrating those few with study over study, you scare away 
more women. I was interested when the first study started, but now I am 
really tired of being a study object.

hi,

> Is there more activity on IRC for KDE women?

you'll see women activity in KDE in all KDE channels on IRC.  that was the 
point Charles actually wanted to stress: women interaction in KDE is within 
KDE not within kde-women. it does not take long to see kde-women itself is 
quite dead. And this is good. Take Lauri or me, we are involved in kde and 
have no time left to be involved in kde-women specifically. 
i know women are difficult to spot in a project like kde but several got 
involved recently at key points. studying that would need from you to be 
inside the project.
in fact if you would sponsor me i could analyze that for you :-)

cheers!

Anne-Marie

Yeah, that's why I was wondering about the kde-woman db. There were some 
suggestions for alternatives on the kde-www list, but what I like about 
bugs.kde.org is that it is a KDE-wide system, used and maintained. 

- divide et impera ? -
I was thinking of providing custom "views" of the kde bug database to directly 
provide a configurable subset of the database content based on the product, 
something like when you select a product or run the wizard. Such a view can 
be embedded in the product's website, and be maintained by the product's 
active community with relevant extra information(kde-women, kde-webteam, 
kde-quality (check JJs) etc). Of course, bugs.kde.org should still be 
available and it would be the place were everything is put together.

Benefits: easy access to file bugs, manage and maintain "bugs" database for 
kde teams and provide more meaningful representation/extra information.
Drawbacks: view system needs to be developed and has to be easy to maintain so 
they will actually be maintained

Actually, tasks/jobs database would be a better name than bugs database, since 
not only bugs are managed and it's more positive ;) .

:) I would like to get involved with kde-women, although the upcoming week(s) 
I will not be available that much. Thanks again.

I really like that idea!! bugs.kde.org has proven to work very well. Still 
it's size grows and grows and it's difficult to find things. 
Adding views and maybe special tags to it would be a great thing imho. To 
assign a tag to an already existing entry is easy to do.

Hello everyone,

This sounds like a very sensible idea, anybody knows the bugs.kde.org 
internals? is it db-based?

Anyway it would be nice to have a more lively kde-women. Guess we need 
to start thinking about ways to revive it. Who is in charge of website 
update? Do we have any IRC regulars? Maybe we should think about a 
"meeting" to discuss ideas and get to know each other.

Ines

Together with Annma I ported it last time. I haven't any time to update

Message-ID: <20050420102450.10550.qmail@web51008.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

My name is Paula Costa and I'm joining today to this
mailing list.
I'm from Brazil but now I'm living in Italy since  I'm
an electrical
engineer and I'm currently doing a master course in
wireless technologies at
the Politecnico di Torino.

I found this KDE women initiative just great and it
will be a pleasure for
me to help.
I just don't know how I could help...
I consider myself just a beginner user of Linux and I
have light programming
experience in standard C and Java.

Maybe I could help translating documents or
applications to Portuguese that
is my mother tongue, but I also could challenge
myself programming something (I'll try to give a look
at the tutorials at
the KDE homepage...)
I could also test technical applications if needed
because I'm really good
to find problems :-))

So, congratulations for this initiative!!!

Best Regards,

Paula

Hi,

Pleased to meet you,  Jenecai and congratulation for the soon coming birth. I 
guess you'll be quite busy the next months! Please keep in touch and send us 
some news when the baby is there, OK?

I put a new doc online on the KDE-Women website.
http://women.kde.org/articles/tutorials/kdevelop_templates/index.php
I am testing KDevelop templates in order to fix the ones that are broken and I 
take the opportunity of making a doc about them so it'll be easier for 
newbies to choose a project to start with.
Please have a look and feel free to send your comments.

If any of you has a KDE related article, howto, interview, tips,... please 
feel free to ask for cvs access and add it.

If any of you wants to update the website, feel free to ask as well. It would 
be great to have a cleaning and some new ideas.

Cheers,

Anne-Marie
