Hi,
overlooking the current mess in www + the mass of *.kde.org domains (some
 have even own cvs modules) I would like to know if it wouldn't be possible
 to clean that up a "bit". ;)

My proposal would be:

a) move the applications homepages to www/apps/"appname" + make the
"appname".kde.org domains pointing to that + create a index in www/apps whi=
ch
shows what application are around there with links

b) move ALL *.kde.org subdomains into www/areas/"areaname" + make the
"areaname".kde.org domains pointing to that (and again index)

c) move ALL internationalisation pages to www/i18n/?? (or
 www/international/?? or even seperated www-?? modules)

d) let all this pages (after we have our new design ready + xhtml conform)
 use the templates located at www/templates to get one corporate identity
 look for the whole kde web sites (but that is AFTER we have done the first
 hard restructuring)

e) use <base href=3D"http://www.kde.org"> (and let the *.kde.org domains not
change the docroot, only redirect them to the given subdirs, which will make
links consistent to the base url, which might be set different (like
www.kde.?? for the translated websites which will get a document root set to
www/international/?? or www/i18n/??)

Would that be possible ?

BTW., would be nice to get a common suffix for the pages that are written in
php, should we use .html (as now on www.kde.org) or the more comment .php
suffix (if .php should be it, please change that the server accepts
index.php), the includes will get .inc.

P.S.
Please constructive answers, no flames ;P
This mail goes to kde-core-devel + kde-www and the sysadmin(s), please feel
free to forward to any other people involved in the www stuff.

cu
Christoph

Hello,=20

I just subscribed this list and want to introduce myself:=20

My Name is Ute and I would like to do some private programming with KDE.

But first I want to collect informations and listen to your experiences, =
so=20
that I have a good start. And I have to learn more about the QT-classes.

I am working fully, and develop Software with Microsoft's MFC - and don't=
 like=20
it very much, it works in many cases more intuitive than logical. That's =
also=20
a reason to try another system.

if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Ute

Subject: [Kde-women]Requirements for the new kde.org website
Message-ID: <1035766463.633ce1c0JaseOne@myrealbox.com>

Firstly apologies for the cross posting but I wanted to get the attention o=
f all potential stakeholders, so if I have missed any important groups pl=
ease forward this on or alternatively if you have gotten this mail and ar=
en't interested in the re-design of kde.org please ignore it.

As many of you are already aware there have been several prototypes floatin=
g about for a new design of the kde.org website, the main ones of which a=
re listed below:

http://kde.org/testing/

http://www.kde.org/testing/modified-2/index.html

http://usability.kde.org/newdesign/

It is becoming more and more apparent however that none of these designs co=
me close to meeting everyone's requirements as the discussions on how the=
y should be modified seem neverending.

I am hence proposing that a proper Requirements Specification be drafted so=
 a design can then be implemented that best meets everyone's needs and wa=
nts. Some may see this as an unecessary delay holding back implementing a=
 new design but I think it is a step backwards that will ultimately reap =
many benefits. 

To complete this document I will be trawling through all of the previous po=
sts and I also ask that if anyone has any input that they would like to a=
dd that they reply to this email to the kde-www list (please don't reply =
to whichever list you receive this from as I don't wish to pollute the ot=
her lists, if you are interested in following the discussion then you can=
 join kde-www :-)

I will be storing these requirements on http://usability.kde.org/newdesign =
simply as it is a convenient place for me to do so. I am also contemplati=
ng on drafting a survey to better guage the collective needs and wants of=
 all, but will do this once the requirements have been gathered.

Again if you have any thoughts on any of the above please reply to kde-www =
or if you want to reply off list for some reason please email me direct.
