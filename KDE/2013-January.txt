Subject: [Kde-women] room-sharing at FOSDEM
Message-ID: <CADTthn8g1tbSY5m63iTCWwvWs1CZnMF_FCOeE+2Uk7rd19B3iw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey ladies,

For anyone going to FOSDEM next week and doesn't yet have
accommodation, I'm looking for someone to share a twin room in Max
Hotel [1] in Brussels city centre. I booked it while it was on "sale"
at 50EUR/night, for 3 nights from Friday 1st of Feb to Monday 4th.

Cheers,
Laura
