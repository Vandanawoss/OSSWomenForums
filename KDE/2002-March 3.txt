Seeing that the ice has been broken, let me introduce myself:

For starters, yes! I'm a female! :)  I'm a jr. at the University of Puerto 
Rico, pulling a double major in CS and Math.  I'm a 21-yr. old Texan living 
in Puerto Rico (don't ask!)  I learned of Linux early in my sophomore year, 
and have been using it ever since.  All this [school] year, my sole OS has 
been RH7.2.  I'm a proud KDE user, used Gnome once at my old job ... 
Why did I subscribe?  I've already subscribed to Grrls-only with Val and 
company ... was browsing around through the KDE mailing lists ... and ouila! 
Here I am.  My email was just recently added this week.  I use my computer, 
and hence, KDE, everyday, at least some 4 hours.  I'm not to keen on 
programming, but well, it comes with the studies.  I'm also interested in 
digital art.  

That just about sums up my mini-intro.

Hi all,

this list isn't really active... still there are 85 people subscribed and I 
am _very_ curious about who you all are. From the email addresses I'd say, 
you are about 80% female. There are also some email collecters for search 
machines subscribed and some I cannot say which gender they are. 

The email address look really interesting... so what about doing a round of 
introductions? Who are you? How did you find this list? How long have you 
been subsribed? Why are you subscribed? Where do you come from? How old are 
you (ok, forget about this one ;-)? Do you work in IT? What is your 
profession? Are you a student? What OS do you mainly use? How did you learn 
Linux/KDE? Do you use KDE on a daily basis? Do you miss something in KDE? 
...lot's of questions.

Looking forward to see what's under the curtain of anonymity ;-)

Hi! I'm Sallie Krebs, from Illinois (USA), *way* too old (51)

I've been subscribed from day one... I think I was contacted by someone 
in IRC about joining the list, but I don't remember who it was now. The 
reason I subscribed was to learn more about KDE, and hopefully to 
participate and share some of my experiences with others. 
Unfortunately- due to work and other commitments- I haven't had time to 
really participate in any of the lists I've joined, which include 
several for Kapital products I've purchased plus Progeny (now, 
unfortunately, defunct.)

I work at the Post Office as an electronics technician- I maintain and 
repair mail processing equipment, computers, etc. 

I've been running Linux for about 4 years now- Debian for most of that 
time. I think the first distro I tried was Caldera which introduced me 
to KDE. I tried Gnome a couple of times, but found that KDE was much 
easier to use and has far more functionality. I haven't tried Gnome in 
over a year now, though. I *do* love having a choice and will probably 
do more experimenting with different desktops when I have more time- 
maybe in 4 years when I will, hopefully, retire :)

Do I miss something in KDE? That's hard to answer... It's been about a 
year and a half since I had windoze installed and in use even on a part 
time basis. I do have to use it at work, however, and am constantly 
cursing the lack of functionality that I take for granted in Linux/KDE. 
I keep hearing that Linux isn't ready for the desktop... HUH? It 
certainly has everything I need, and more! Oh, well, there is one 
thing- but it's a Konqueror problem, not KDE. I can't do my online 
banking using Konq, so I have to use Mozilla. I read an online 
discussion about the problem- it has something to do with Java. Overall 
though, KDE is spectacular!

Hi, I'm Tina Gasperson; I work as a reporter for the Open Source Developers 
Network (OSDN). I've been using Linux and KDE for about 2 1/2 years. I try to 
stay subscribed to a lot of mailing lists because its a good way to tune in 
to what's going on in the community; but I specifically sought out and became 
a part of this list and also the LinuxChix list in order to hang out with 
other females who are interested in Linux. It's reassuring to be reminded I'm 
not the only one.

Hi

I'm Rachel, I'm a web developer with my own company - working mainly with 
ASP/SQL Server (sorry!) but increasingly with PHP/mySQL and learning Java 
becase I don't want to get sucked into the black hole that is .NET.

I use Linux (and therefore KDE) on the desktop around 50% of the time. I run 
Debian (testing).

I'm a mother with a 4 year old daughter, as well as messing around with 
computers I'm doing a course in World Religions with the Open University here 
in the UK.

Hi all :)

I am 57y old and soon going to retreat !! (60y in france..) but I hope next year to go... I think there is a lot much more to do than working as a slave for capitalism... In france when one reaches 50y old he is considered good for the rubbish bin !!! 

I registered here because I was looking for a tutorial how to use qtdesigner in kdev... And the only one my taste at that time (2y ago) was anne marie one...

I am analyst at NEC computer international .. Based in Angers France... But we work only with windows and I like very much linux... I have still a lot of project to do... Mainly two : Theory of 5th dimension a critical work in physics about the 4th Relativity's theory)... dimension and the implementation of a "TRINARY system"... I worked on the 1th for about 40y now and the second appears very recently following my theory... 5y ago about... 

Unfortunatly I am working alone on this subjects... Otherwise I think they would be more advanced... 

I like the Open "way of thinking"... And that's mainly why I like linux...

I see we have some things in common... I run Debian- mostly unstable. 
I'm fighting with getting Apache/PHP/MySQL working at the moment. My 
husband is the database & networking guru, but mostly in the Windows 
and Novell areas- so he can't help me much. When we retire in a few 
years, I'd love to do something like you- in web development.

Yes, I forgot to check the message headers. I already sent them an 
email about it, but they haven't fixed the KDE Women list yet. Most of 
the others are ok now, so I guess they're working on it. I just have to 
remember to edit the subject line. Thanks!

Yes, I'm sorry... theKompany. I've purchased Kapital, Quanta Gold, 
DataArchitect, and DocBrowser from them. Kapital is still very much 
beta software, but it's usable. I've installed the others, but haven't 
had time to really work with them yet. My husband was really impressed 
with DataArchitect, as comparable Windows products cost much more (it's 
an entity relationship diagram editor... yet another thing I'm just 
learning about.) They do seem to respond quickly to questions in their 
mailing lists, and post "bug-fix" releases quite regularly.

Hi Eva, kde-women,

> The email address look really interesting... so what about doing a round of
> introductions? Who are you? 

A 27-year-old jazz pianist / studied physical chemist / turned Perl hacker 
out of Berlin, Germany. Actually, I don't have _very_ much to do with KDE. I 
joined this list, and also kde-devel because I wanted to spark a project that 
I alone cannot develop: because I'm working as a freelance musician, I'm in 
desperate need of a program that:
- has an interface to KOrganizer to keep track of dates
- has an interface to MySQL to maintain a musicians and customers database
- helps me keep track with invoices & stuff
- can do bookkeeping WITH the option of taking the VAT out by triple booking
  (is this the right word?).

Obviously, Perl/Tk is not the language of choice for that. But I did not have 
time to get down into Qt that much that I could swing it alone. Plus, I don't 
have the time. It may be an antitheton to Linux/KDE/Open Source, but what 
we're lacking most is business software. I'm maintaining a computer network 
for our small musicians collective here in Berlin (2 desktop computers, one 
web/mail/fax server/gateway, one file/scan server/audio/graphics, plus 2 
laptops, the whole thing running on SuSE and Debian Linuces, which I 
exclusively use some 6 hours a day.

I learned about Linux/KDE from a friend at university some four years ago and 
have used it ever since, picking up knowledge by myself, bit by bit. Hobbies 
outside of piano and computing: composition / reading / collecting and 
smoking pipes (odd for a woman ;-).

All the best to all of you,

Amy from Berlin

Hi Eva, kde-women,

of

Hola, I'm ninteen (well, almost twenty) year old girl
living near Marburg. Since August last year I'm 
going to be Fachinformatikerin/Systemintegration.
over a half year has faded now and I feel I learned 
a lot in this time.
In my class at school are 15 guys and 3 girls.
I learned a lot through mailinglists and I found
this list because I had to do a research on linux..
even write some small c++ programms with kdevelop..
We don't use linux at work but I got it at home,
though I need a bootmanager to choose between linux and xp.
don't have much time at the moment, cause I 
go between Frankfurt and Marburg everyday, but this
will change soon hopefully.

I really hope this list gets lively
ciao chix

nina

I'm Patricia (trish) from Munich, Germany, and I earn my living being an
editor with LinuxUser and Linux-Magazin, German monthlies dealing with 
Linux exclusively. Though this is very much of a dream job (no Windows!), 
it is extremely time consuming and frequently kills all my efforts to keep 
a tiny programming project (using Qt) alive.

I have however another project going: lists.answergirl.de is a mailing list
server running Ecartis (one of the few open source projects initiated and
mainly run by a woman) that hosts a few technical and women only mailing 
lists. The most prominent ones are lynn, a German (and quite lively) 
mailing list for female Linuxers and Unixers, and ada, a female programmers'
list, as well German. Feel free to join us if you're interested in German 
techtalk among women and still have enough bandwidth for yet another 
mailing list :).  (BTW: Whoever set the link in 
http://women.kde.org/projects/div/sisterpages.html -- thanks a lot :) 

KDEwise I'm not so much more than a user, if it was not for professional reasons,
I'd be happy with a couple of xterms ;) And I still have this vision of
a women only software project... 


Best

Hi :)

I think the last thing I wrote on here was my last introduction.  I reall=

wish I had more time to help create a more active community, but it's sti=

nice to see traffic on the list :)

Here's what I am not: I'm not a programmer, I'm not a Linux User, I'm not=

physicist, and I don't smoke a pipe (well, I may have once, but I didn't=20
inhale, I swear)

I'm 29, I'm from New Zealand, and live now in Sweden, I have three childr=

I have absolutely no skill at programming, I once wrote a shell script th=

nearly does what I want, most of the time.  I'm not much interested in be=

What do I do for KDE?  Well, I'm KDE's Documentation Coordinator, which s=

is pretty cute.

My other task for KDE is more peripheral, I'm one of the FreeBSD packager=

which can be interesting at times.

My goals for KDE? I want KDE to have documentation as excellent as the Fr=
eeBSD=20

directly as a dead-tree book by O'Reilly.  KDE is not there yet, and some=

days I feel like we're slipping further back, but that's the goal. =20

My other goal is to make sure KDE stays a cross platform/cross OS desktop=

And finally, I need to learn to not write epic novels when I'm starting o=

it is ;-) 
Actually I prefer moderating people instead of a dead list :-)

In case you don't want to remember the right email, you can also subscribe 
with several email addresses and set the "no mail" option. (That is what I 
do, since I forget the right emails too...)

After reading all your interesting stories, I guess it's also my turn. So for 
all of you who didn't read my last introduction, here is a new one:

Well, I am german and also leave in Germany - in Darmstadt, that's close to 
Frankfurt. I'm 29 and at the moment I am a PhD student at the Technical 
University in Darmstadt. Before that I studied electrical engineering and 
there I first met Linux and KDE :-)

In the meanwhile I have a boyfriend who is as computer addictive as I am and 
we only have linux at home. We both spend a lot of our free time with KDE, 
but each of us found an own corner of activity. 
My stuff is mostly the event organisation, like Linuxtag and CeBIT, but also 
a lot of testing, writing bug reports, administrating several mailinglists 
etc. The most recent project is a new KDE domain called events.kde.org, where 
I'd like to have some kind of database to organize events, where people can 
register for an event and other can see who's coming. So I am going to 
struggle with mySQL... 

During my job I do a lot of C++ coding and I am very much interested in 
software engineering with design patterns, refactoring and XProgramming.

The reason why I like linux and KDE so much is, that I can do things on my 
own. I can always learn how to solve problems and if necessary I can change 
the system by changing the code. That doesn't mean, that I 'm necessarily 
doing it, but I appreciate the freedom very much. 
So why KDE-women? It's great to know, that I am not the only (weird) one :-))

And the rest of my life... well, I don't exactly smoke, but I appreciate a 
good single malt very much. Also I love italian pasta and like to experiment 
on the weekends :)  Another hobby is motorbiking and reading good books (e.g. 
by Marianne Fredrikson, an excellent swedish author).

Ciao,
eva

With great proudness we present to you: "KDE-cafe"

KDE-cafe is the virtual chill-out zone of KDE, a cross between 
slashdot and irc, a cross between the local pub and the opinions page 
of your newspaper. Specially designed for KDE addicts like you.

You know those endless discussions abouts Tabs vs. Spaces? Which 
editor works best? Why STL is evil? Whether Microsoft should be 
broken up in 10.000 pieces or Bill Gates should become president of 
the U.N.? Those discussions will finally have found a place of their 
own on KDE's latest mailinglist: KDE-cafe. There is one rule: don't 
hit each other with the chairs, play it fair.

Of course KDE-cafe is also a great place for sharing your latest 
vacation pictures with your KDE friends or posting interesting links 
to stories about KDE, life or the universe.

Behind the tap of KDE-cafe you will find nobody less than our own 
Tink, famous for "The People Behind KDE" series.

We hope to see you soon on KDE-cafe@kde.org

Hi,

Last week I announced the new KDE mailing list KDE-cafe, the virtual 
chill-out zone of KDE, a cross between slashdot and irc, a cross 
between the local pub and the opinions page of your newspaper.

As you probably all know there was a server crash. A back-up copy of 
the subscribers list was restored, which means we lost more than half 
of our new subscribers. If you subscribed early last week to kde-cafe 
and haven't seen any mail the last few days chances are that your 
subscription got lost. Visit
