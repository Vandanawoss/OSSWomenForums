Subject: [Kde-women] A Survey on Defect Management Practices in Free/Open
	Source Software
Message-ID: <20070404082450.M25459@pu.ac.in>

Dear KDE Women Contributors,

I seek help from designers, developers, testers,defect fixers,project 
managers or playing any other key role in Free/Open Source software 
development or maintenence 
in carrying out a study on practices and problems of defect management in 
various Free/Open Source Software projects. The 
insights gained from the study can further help us to extract publicly 
accessible defect data and determine impact of defect management practices 
on software quality. 
Please spend a few minutes of your precious time to fill up the 
Questionnaire. The most of the questions follow multiple choice formats and 
are quite easy to answer. 

To have the Online Questionnaire, please visit:

(You can also copy and paste this link into your browser, and hit the 
'Return' key.) 

I hope you will find all the questions interesting and thought-provoking. 
Your answers will be kept anonymous.The data thus collected will 
only be used for research purpose.It would be nice if you may further refer 
this mail to others actively engaged with Free/Open Source Software 
development. If you have any query or suggestions then 
feel free to contact. 

Thank You

Subject: [Kde-women] introduction of myself
Message-ID: <4631E125.6090406@tin.it>

Hallo
 my name is Alessia and I live in Italy.
I known kde in  2004 and I used it on a Mandrake 10 since  when I update 
Mandrake to Mandriva 2006. Initially I chosed another Desktop 
Enviroment( just for experiment) But I returned to Kde at the first 
reistallation. Now I have  kde 3.4 on Mandriva  and Kde 3.5 on Kubuntu ( 
on my laptop). I found Kde 3.5 very best on regard to 3.4.

My favourite apps are Kmail and Kontact, Kaffeine, Kate, K3b , Knotes 
and many others

do you think It would be enough for my introdution? :-)
best regards
Alessia
