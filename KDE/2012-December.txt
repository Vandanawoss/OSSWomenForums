Hi all,

James Vasile, who maintains http://planeteria.org/wfs/ asked me to let
women in the GNOME community know that all women who contribute to
free software (and sometimes blog about it) are welcome to add their
blogs to the Women in Free Software planet. Please e-mail him at james
at hackervisions dot org providing RSS to your blog or feed you want
to get aggregated.

We are announcing Outreach Program for Women participants for January
- April 2013 tomorrow, and since they will be working with many
different free software organizations, we will be aggregating their
blogs on that planet, in addition to the planets specific to each
participant's organization.

Thanks,
Marina
