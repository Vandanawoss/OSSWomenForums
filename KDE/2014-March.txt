Khyati, I'm not sure if I should address this email to you or Gaurav
Jain because both of you decided to email the same list with identical
messages within hours of each other:
http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-women&m=139422370415814&w=2
http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-women&m=139422370215813&w=2

I'm assuming you both are  potential GSoC students? If so, please dont
spam the list with identical messages like the above - it sends a very
negative message about Indian students and leads to stereotyping.
Unlike Indian universities, which turn a blind eye to mass copying
(plagiarism), such things are viewed seriously.

Among other skills (like programming) one of the main things mentors
and their Orgs are looking for is the students ability to think for
themselves, understand the problem-set, the ability to communicate
their ideas, ask specific questions while coming up with potential
programming solutions, respecting other people's time and effort,
etc... Potential applicants are better off trying to gain some of
these soft-skills alongside their programming-fu.

</end thinking out loud>

Goodluck with GSoC!

Is there any particular reason you are sending this to the KDE-women's list?

FWIW: if you are interested in coding you should brush up your
knowledge of C++ and the Qt framework, as well as QML. There are
extensive guides on how to get started that you should be able to find
quite easily by searching the web, starting maybe with the KDE guide
for new developers: http://flossmanuals.net/kde-guide/
