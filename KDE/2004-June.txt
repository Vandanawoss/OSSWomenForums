Welcome, Shweety

It is sometimes a bit too quiet on here, but hopefully 
soon it will liven up.

full ack.

BTW, is any of you planning to come to the KDE World Summit in August?
=> http://conference2004.kde.org

I think there also were some plans about a KDE Women meeting. Any news about 
that?

Cheers,
eva

Hello!

I've only recently started actually using Linux, although I've been keeping my 
eye on it for a few years.  I've been using computers in one way or another 
for 25 years now, in jobs (data entry, mainframe operations - currently back 
to just data entry) and as a hobbyist (programming in BASIC for Sharp 
handheld computers many many moons ago!).

I was an enthusiastic Amiga user for many years, and resisted buying "PC" 
hardware for quite a while, but with the demise of Commodore gave in to the 
inevitable. I've never felt the urge to tinker as a hobbyist with Windows 
(shudder), but now I've started using Linux (Mandrake 10) and learning how it 
all works, and how to use the command line.. - all nicely echoing my happy 
experiences with the Amiga - I'm getting enthused again!

At the moment, whilst I'm still getting to grips with Linux, my main useful 
skill would probably be in helping with documentation, like proofreading and 
helping create beginners guides.  I would like to get back into coding, 
though.  C and suchlike don;t look to be quitemy cup of tea, and BASIC seems 
to be out of fashion these days. Any reccomends as to a currently useful 
language of that kind of ease of use  would be much appreciated. 

I'm 46 and live in the UK.

Hi :)
As i was reading your message I think gambas (vb like without the buggs... lol) could be one of your favorite GUI in future...
gambas.sourceforge.net
i am not an expert in developing but i am learning it in the pedagogical aspect !
It's really like a game for those who like play with coding...
Kind regards
HG

Well, QT and KDE are coded using C++ using object-oriented techniques. 
Both toolkits have bindings which enable you to code GUI apps with the same 
look & feel but using a different language. Please have at this page:

http://developer.kde.org/language-bindings/

The most popular ones are the python bindings actually. 

Please keep us updated on your progress - I am very interested on feedback on 
using the bindings :-)

Greetings,
eva
