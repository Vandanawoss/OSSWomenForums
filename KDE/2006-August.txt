Hi Chani,

Congrats on your SoC project, it's great to have newcomers in KDE, especially
women!!! This list is pretty quiet, yes but maybe it can be revived! I just got
my ADSL connection in France (I moved from Canada end of June and was on
holiday) so I am pretty verbose right now!

Hello All,

Trying to give my contribution to wake up this list, I
will introduce myself.
My name is Paula, 28 years old, and I'm from Brazil.
I'm an Electrical Engineer with some experience
developing software.
My interests in participating KDE Women project are:
- First of all, incentivate projects for the Linux
world developed by women;
- Trying to engage myself in running or future
projects (even if I don't have
a huge experience as a programmer).

Right now, I'm nursering my 5 months old daughter and
attending some master classes
about the development of games using Java technology.
Due to both facts I`m current interested in developing
computer games for babies or
little children.
Any idea or proposals?

Best Regards,

Paula

Hi,

There is a need for kids software as there are few available. In KDE-Edu we try
to develop educational software but there is none for very young children.
The first one your child would use would be a "baby keys" one. Typing on any key
will trigger an action as a sound, a baloon inflating, an animation of
something...
Any small game which respond to a baby typing would be nice.
A coloring book as well is missing. TuxPaint is a nice painting tool though.
You can try GCompris which is not KDE but it'll give you an idea of what exists.

I also have a nearly-6-months daughter :) and I am also interested in kid
software :))

Nice meeting you!

Hi Sweta,

You cannot code using qt3 and kde2, you have to have the same number version.
To update kde2 to kded3 on Redhat, I guess you can use the Redhat package
manager probably.

Please tell us more specifically what you need to understand and maybe we can
explain.

Good luck,

Anne-Marie
