Subject: Ohio LinuxFest 2017 Call for Presentations
Message-ID: <20170430014224.4989621173@nyx.nyx.net>

The 2017 Ohio LinuxFest is looking for presentations on Friday and
Saturday, September 29 and 30.  Please visit the CFP page
<https://ohiolinux.org/call-for-presentations/> for full details
about submitting a proposal.  The deadline is Friday, July 14, but
the sooner you can submit a talk, the better.

Started in 2003, the Ohio LinuxFest <https://ohiolinux.org/> is an
annual grassroots conference in Columbus, Ohio dedicated to open
access for all.  Presentations relating to any free and open source
software, not just Linux, are welcome.  Areas where we've had talks in
the past include networking, system administration, development, and
community building.

Our audience consists of people at all skill levels.  Prior speaking
experience is a plus, although we do try to provide opportunities for
first-time speakers.  If you have any questions, please contact us at
<speakers at ohiolinux.org>.  We look forward to hearing from you!
