Hi!

I heard about this plans and I am glad to hear that it should be located
in central or south europe. I think a lot of developers can meet there
next year. Maybe more then this year. I hope that it will be a great
conference and that there will be made a lot of improvements.

I personally think that we should have a seperate meeting and I will
give some reasons for my opinion. I had a long discussion about the
suggestion to merge the two meetings and I see positive and negative
aspects as well. In the end I made up my mind that it would not be a
good solution for kde-women.

The kde-women meeting should have is own program and I don't think that
this would be realisable at the Conference because there will already
be a whole conference program and you won't be able to participate at
both programs. I don't think that it would be possible to get both
programs in one schedule. The kde-women meeting should get talks,
workshops and irc meetings as well. I think there will be a lot more
than this, but that has to be worked out later. This all should happen
in a special atmosphere. All women should get the chance to get known to
each other and to have a good time together and become friends. And I am
not sure, if that is possible in an atmosphere with hundred male
developers around. That is a big crowd and I don't think that the
kde-women meeting is meant like this.

I know that a lot of people fear that kde-women would become seperated
from KDE, but I don't think that a kde-women only meeting means that
this will happen. We want to invite every woman to join us and we hope 
that you all get involved with KDE. Contributors are needed in all 
sections and the kde-women meeting isn't only a meeting for women who 
already work on KDE. The goal of KDE women is still to help each other 
and we are all very glad when new women join us and we want to help them 
especially with such a meeting to get involved in KDE.

I have another reason why I think that merging the meetings isn't a good
idea. The conference includes a one-week hacking session. The
kde-women meeting should be for every woman who wants to contribute to
KDE and is interested in KDE. But that doesn't mean that all of us are
able to code. Some may want to learn coding, therefore we plan a little
workshop to find a starting point with C++/KDE/QT. Others are more
interested in translation or webdesign or writing What's This and so on. 
I hope that a lot of new women will join kde-women and start to
contribute, but they haven't to be a developer and I don't know why we
should have a whole week hacking session. I think we should use the time 
of the kde-women meeting without saying we have a one-week hacking 
session and do what we are planning.

I know that the financial part isn't easy and that the KDE e.V. has a 
financial limit. Nevertheless I would prefer a seperated meeting for 
kde-women, because it should be a kde-women meeting and not only a room 
for women activities at the conference. I think we should try to find a 
sponsor and organize the meeting seperately from the conference.

I would be glad to hear any comment and any ideas for a meeting program, 
a location or a sponsor. And I still like to get mails who is interested 
in a meeting.

Cheers,
Frauke

Well, I wouldn't place the kdewomen-workshops in parallel to the conference, 
but rather make it take place in parallel to the other workshops. During the 
hackfest of the last conferences several developer and non-developer groups 
met for workshops. E.g. there were workshops for usability, koffice, kdepim, 
etc.
BTW, during the conference we also had several non-developer presentations and 
- male developers don't bite (at least they never did that to me ;-).

Well, as I wrote above, the hackfest istn't necessaryly a week where freaky 
male coders only sit in front of their laptops. Also nobody is forced to stay 
all the time. Most of the people arrived for the conference and each day 
during the hackfest some people left. The hackfest is basically a time 
without any fixed program (except meal times and some tourist program) and 
with computers and workshop rooms available. Everyone is free to do whatever 
he/she prefers.

Once you have a concept for the conference you can approach the KDE e.V. board 
at kde-ev-board@kde.org or better the membership list 
kde-ev-membership@kde.org for financial support. I cannot tell you how the 
KDE e.V. will decide, but my guess is, that we can support the conference 
itself only little. Travel costs will probably granted once - either for the 
KDE conference or the KDE-Women conference. But again - this will need to be 
discussed then.

Well, I am interested, but very likely I won't be able to take part in a 
seperate meeting. Time is very limited for me :-(

Sure, but  I think there are a few women who want to participate at both 
events and want to do workshops from the conference
and workshops from the kde-women meeting.

That's true , they don't bite. I never would say that. Because I am 
engaged with one,so I think I know that quite
good. But I don't  know why to make a kde-women meeting at the same time 
and location as the conference, because a kde-women
meeting isn't the same as the conference. But I think we could also do a 
workshop or talks at the conference too, if there is interest (also
from the site of male developers. I can say that the women I talked to 
about the merging, told me that they would prefer to have a
seperated meeting. I don't know if all think like this, I just can say I 
do. And that doesn't mean that I wouldn't want to participate at the 
conference.

Hi! 
After reading all these mails I would say it's a very good idea to have a kde women 
meeting. I'm from Germany and I certainly would try to participate. I think it'll be 
very hard to manage that everyone can come but I hope it will not be like a one time 
only meeting so that everyone who wants to gets a chance to come sometime.  
For me it could get a little complicated to participate next summer because I can't 
just skip school and in the holidays I'll be somewhere in the wilderness of Canada not 
even having any internet connection for some weeks. But I'll certainly try to arrange 
something so that it may work out. 
Greetings, 
Anke

Message-ID: <3FB64C29.9070501@kde.org>

Hi all,

unfortunately I have to say that the start of the translation of our 
website is still not visible. We have to wait some more time...
The problem is that we need a translation file, called .pot file and to 
create such a file for a website is different from creating one for an 
application. And we are still waiting to get the script for the creation 
of such files get ready. Unfortunately has the developer who is working 
on this script not much time, because he is working hard for uni.

I hope he'll find soon time to get the file ready, so that the 
translation can start. Until then I hope you all can understand him and 
will wait for the file, because we will need all your help to get the 
website translated.

Cheers,
Frauke

Hi all,

so this is my first mail on the KDE-women-list.
Ok, some facts about me:
I'm 24 years old, I study computer and education science at the
Otto-von-Guericke-university of Magdeburg (eastern Germany) and I will
finish my studies in Spring 2005. I hope to find a job in software
development for educational software or eLearning-stuff.
I'm kind of a geek girl, spending more time in front of my computer than
being outside and catch some fresh air ;-)
My interests are programming (esp. Java, but also some PHP) und Linux
(using Debian with kernel 2.4.22 and of course KDE 3.1).
Besides computers I also like cooking, music (I have a weird taste,
listening to metal, punk, alternative but also blues n swing, r&b...),
inlineskating annd dry red wine.
Well, as I don't know what to write else I will stop here - feel free to
ask me if there are some things you like to know.

Cya!
Katrin

I'd like to get involved with kde-women, but would like to do some lurking

Hi Katrin,

welcome to KDE Women!! 
Maybe you are interested in helping developing our website women.kde.org that 
is written in PHP. I don't know if there are Java Bindings in KDE, but maybe 
you like to code on some edu applications. 
Do you already know CVS? 
It would be very cool to work with you and I think a lot of people would be 
glad to see a new woman in KDE with developing skills.

Hope you'll become an active KDE Woman!!

Cheers and have a lot of fun with KDE!

Frauke

Subject: [Kde-women] The future of KDE Women - a personal view of things
Message-ID: <200311261940.56307.oster@kde.org>

Hi all,

today I want to say some or some more words about the current situation and 
the future of KDE Women. As I started to port the website to the KDE style 
some months ago, I hoped that it would help to see some more women actively 
involved in KDE. After my long free time period in the summer Uni started for 
me and I couldn't go on working so much on KDE Women as I've done all the 
summer. I worked together with Anne-Marie, who is involved in KDE Women since 
it was founded. We both planned a lot and collected our ideas for KDE Women. 
I will explain our ideas in the next few sentences.

First of all the idea of translating the website. As I started to port the 
website I asked Chris how to start and he told me to read his tutorial about 
programming KDE websites. There I found some notes about i18n tags for the 
translation with the help of .pot files. I questioned Chris a lot about it 
and learned that for the first time it is possible to translate the websites 
in the way the KDE applications are translated. So Anne-Marie and I started 
to include this i18n tags in the code of women.kde.org. Our website is the 
first one of the KDE websites that uses this new method for translation. 
So the question that appears in your mind possibly is:
Why isn't there any translated stuff online?
A very good question with a simple answer:
the translating couldn't start yet, because we haven't got a translation file 
(.pot file) yet. We, as the first people implementing this translation stuff, 
only can wait until this file is ready.
Then I hope that a lot of women will start with the translation of our 
website. And maybe other websites will be transalted too.

A second idea was to create a database to handle a collection of tasks that 
need to be done. Currently I am working on this database and hopefully I will 
soon be able to write the webinterface for it.
The database will work in two ways. You can search through the tasks and 
assign to a task, that you find interesting. And the other way round you can 
add tasks that need to be done. 
Anne-Marie is currently busy with listing missing What's This help. The task 
of writing What's This will be found for example in the database. I would 
like to stress this task because missing What's This help is a leck of 
usability. One of our male supporters wrote a tutorial about how to write 
What's This help, that is linked on our website. I hope that we can improve 
usability by adding this little help texts.
You'll find other tasks as well in the database like little coding tasks, 
artwork, translation, writing or everything else that is needed. The tasks 
will be categorised from easy to difficult, so you can find the right level 
for yourself. This database will also hopefully improve the work between all 
people, who are involved in KDE.

At last I would like to say some words about the big idea of having a KDE 
Women meeting. I asked on this mailinglist if there is interest in meeting 
each other. Everyone who is interested should wrote a personal mail to me. I 
counted the answers I got yet and at the moment there are about ten women, 
who would like to have a meeting. If there are other women, who maybe just 
subscribed to the list or didn't answer yet, but would like to have a 
meeting, please don't be shy and send a mail directly to me with your name 
and the country you come from. We plan to have a meeting in the next summer. 
An idea of a program for the meeting you'll find in the CVS module 
kdepromo/women. More about a meeting will be soon to say.

That are the biggest ideas we want to realise at the moment, our future plans. 
I think that there will be more ideas for KDE Women and I hope that all ideas 
be named.

The last few weeks showed that there are lot of women, who would like to 
translate the website or would like to contribute in other ways. There were 
some subscribtions to the mailinglist and I am glad to see that Anne-Marie 
and I aren't the only women, who are interested in KDE Women.

Now I would like to ask you all to become an active member of the community! 
We need every helpful hand, because we have big and complex tasks for the 
future that we want to realise.

The main reason why I write this mail is that I want to prevent that KDE Women 
get asleep again. I think that the KDE Women project is very important for 
every woman, who is searching for a starting point in KDE. But it isn't only 
important for the whole KDE community. For over two years nothing happend in 
the KDE Women project. As I became involved in KDE there wasn't any activity 
on the mailinglist, the irc channel was completly deserted and silent and the 
website hasn't seen an update for a long time. I made the experience that it 
can be very hard to become involved in the KDE project without having company 
from other women. That is the reason why  I want to help women to find a 
starting point and company. This is also the reason, why I don't want to see 
the project asleep again. So I want to ask every women to start contributing 
in KDE Women to find your starting point and to help others to find theirs.

Two months ago Uni started for me and I have to work hard for my courses. I 
learn a lot of interesting and useful stuff that helps me to improve my 
coding skills and a lot of connected subjects. The subject Computer Science 
that I chose to study is one of the hardest and most laborious subjects on my 
uni. That shorts my time substancial  so that I rarely find time to work on 
KDE Women. I already know that in the next two semesters I won't have any 
time at all, so that I won't be able to work on KDE Women at all. But I would 
like to be sure that things are going on, so I just can ask everyone of you 
to become active and help that KDE Women keeps alove.

Cheers,
Frauke

Yeah of course I'd like to be involved into some action around KDE
women. As you have said in another posting, Uni is very time intensive
and that's the same with me - i have one year to go until I start to
write my final master's thesis (or however you would translate
"Magisterarbeit"). Besides I'm a tutor for younger students and work on
a webbased knowledge base. But I will give my best to work on some stuff
for KDE women. It's a great feeling to be part of a (still) small
project that might be grow soon ;-)
Well I always wanted to learn C++ and Qt (I did some work for my studies
with Qt and OpenGL, but these were only small things) - maybe that's a
chance (and kind of a force) to finally do it.
Actually the Koala-project provides bindings between KDE and Qt on the
one hand and Java on the other hand. But I haven't worked with it yet,
only read about it.

| Do you already know CVS?

Yeah - well I know what it is but I never worked with it - but I guess I
can step into it.

Thanks.

Hope that too.

I would be very interested in a meeting although I'm very new here :-)
Where exactly can I find this CVS module with the program idea?!

Hi!

You can use the Anonymous CVS from kde to check out the kdepromo module.
There is a tutorial about using Anonymous CVS what may help you. See
http://developer.kde.org/source/anoncvs.html 
I started with that too. When you become more active in KDE and send
some patches that will be commited from someone else, you can also ask
the sysadmin for your own cvs account. But for a start anoncvs is really
good. You'll find there the CVS Head ( one hour old version, I guess).
So you can use the newest development version of KDE. In the CVS you can
also have a look at the code of our website. Therefore you have to check
out the following module www/areas/women .
When you need more help just go ahead and ask :)

Hope to see you on a KDE Women meeting :)
 
Cheers,
Frauke

kdepromo is not accessible from anonymous CVS. It contains resources for KDE 
people so you need at least a CVS account. E.g. people are developing their 
slides for presentations there.

Hi all,
I'm Maura and I'm 25 years old. I'm studying computer science (I'll become 
an engineer at the end of my study) at Padua's university(north Italy) and I 
hope to finish it before next summer.
I've some experience in programming in c and c++ (and also java, but I 
don't like it very much) and I'm a linux user (I've a gentoo distro with 
kernel 2.6-test9  and KDE3.1.4 and I'm trying to find some 
space in my hard-disk to install kdeCVS...) and I hope to be involved in 
kde project...I don't have much time these days (I'm working for my 
thesis) but I think I'll find some minutes to dedicate to it..:-)
I'm also working in a research project at university concerning "robocup" 
-> we build and program some robots to play soccer...it's a world-wide 
project and it's an interesting AI application...( www.robocup.org for 
more details)
Other interest? I like cooking , listening music (all genre..) and having 
fun :-)
Maura

Hi Maura!

Welcome to KDE Women :)
Nice to see that another woman is intersted in KDE.
I think with the knowledge of C++ you'll find a lot to do in KDE :) Maybe you
want to help to develop educational programs too. We just added a section to
the website about ideas for new educational software because Anne-Marie and I
think that there are enough applications for chatting and such stuff, but not
enough software that are good for kids :) I hope you'll help us with KDE
development.

Have fun in the KDE Women community :)

Cheers,
Frauke

Hi.
For which magazine do you want to have an interview with a KDE Woman? What is 
the interview about? Maybe I can help you.

Cheers,
