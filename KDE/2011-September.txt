Message-ID: <CAFkLwpXWU=1BgCZYyPjtxzVEeMq5ZYJmGqkjTG0aKoURBq++6g@mail.gmail.com>

Heya ladies :)

Oct. 7th is Ada Lovelace Day and I was wondering if anyone has any
cool ideas. Last year we did a video with photos of some of us and
some nice music. What's it gonna be this year? Let's brainstorm a bit.


Cheers
Lydia

Well, I'm going to see if I can do an Avon Fund-raising Campaign for
the National Cervical Cancer Coalition.  In the interests of full
disclosure, I am an Independent Avon Representative.  And well I
wonder if anyone else thinks that a fundraiser of some sort, to
support those looking for a cure for the cause of her death would be a
good way to honour her memory this year.

Looking at all all I've found on her, makes me totally re-imagine the
stereotypical female programmer from the socially inept geek we all
see on TV, to a feminine social leader that can be respected by her
peers as an "Enchantress"/woman and as Programmer (OK in her day it
was, more like Mathematician and lady versus woman).  In fact it makes
it more believable to me that until the 1950s, most programmers were
women, because it was seen as 'light' work, versus the 'hard' work of
computer engineering.  Makes you wonder what she would have
accomplished had she not died at the age of 36.

It might not be along the lines of what you were thinking as a
response, but I think one of the best ways we can honour and celebrate
those who have led the way and passed on is to do something to better
the community.  Like for Grace Hopper, I would think a supporting the
USO or to an organization working on making computers more user
friendly (like say, any of the OSS community groups?) would be
appropriate.

Blogging is always cool. I did that two years ago, about the women in
FOSS who have inspired me. This year the Ubuntu-Women are running a
contest featuring stuff women make.

By the way, it makes me happy to see this list (and the IRC channel)
being used. :-)

Message-ID: <CAFkLwpUOv+mtGS1Yrthmg6TbsNzaJygaF4dH6d9cUwouX94Otg@mail.gmail.com>

Heya folks :)

Ada Lovelace Day is on 7th of October and I and a few other people
would love to have a programming tutorial on IRC on that day. It'd be
a "for women and their friends" event, meaning men are welcome if
they're nice but the main focus are women). The goal of the tutorial
would be writing a first small KDE application or fixing a bug. If we
have teachers for both we could also do two tutorials.
I'm looking for a teacher for this. I and others will help with
promotion. Any takers?


Cheers
Lydia

Not necessarily but it would of course be nice.

She said she can't promise she'll be available that day so can't do it.

Heya folks :)

We're planning to have some tutorials on Ada Lovelace Day (7th Oct.).
It'll be a "for women and their friends" event, meaning men are
welcome but not the main focus of the event. I have someone doing a
programming tutorial already. It'd be awesome to have someone else do
a non-programming tutorial. Bug triage, translation or documentation
would be great topics for that I think. The tutorials would happen on
IRC and I'd take care of most of the promotion.

Anyone willing to be a teacher for this? Contact me asap please.


Cheers
Lydia

Perfect! It's yours. Thanks a lot.
Could you give me a short blurb for your session and maybe an outline
if you have that?

That's pretty much up to you. I'd suggest 30 mins or an hour.

I am interested in doing a bugsquad introduction: how to give a hand
in bug triaging.
