I meant to post this early this week but life .... Sorry for the
delay. Today I added Lydia Pintscher <lydia at kde.org> and she along
with Claire are the two list owners (not just moderators, although
both names are in that field too) for the kde-women list.  I have
removed my email from both -owner and moderator fields and sent the
list password to Lydia in a private mail with a cc to the -owner, so
please change the password.

ciao,
