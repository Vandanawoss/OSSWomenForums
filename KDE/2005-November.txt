Hello Group,

I have written my first kde application - a kicker applet.  I must admit, I've 
had a lot of fun writing this little program for my lab that reminds people when 
it's time to do their backups.  However, there is one problem left that I need 
to resolve.  When I install my application into the kicker, and I open my 
"configure" panel for my applet, the entire kicker panel locks up (blocks) until 
I close my configuration window eg. I cannot use any of the kde menus, switch 
workspaces, or open applications from the panel.  I have installed some other 
third-party kicker applets, and they do the same thing for me.    I am using kde 
3.4, but I believe that kde 3.3 also has the same problem.  Are there any applet 
programmers out there that can help me?

Thanks!
Leigh Willard

This is strange, as the kicker applets I have running here don't show that 
behaviour. 

For your own app you should check wether your dialog is modal. there is a 
parameter in the contstructor switching between modal and non-modal.

Hope that helps! Otherwise I suggest to ask on kde-devel at kde.org.

Greetings,
eva

Hi Eva,

Okay I just checked and modal is definitely set to false.  But what I did was 
take the code of another application, then re-wrote it with my own code.  So if 
there was something wrong in the original code, I have no doubt copied it.

I am going to start work on my second panel applet today, and this time I am 
going to start from code that works properly when I click on "configure". 
However, I had a hard time finding an example application that doesn't block me 
when I click on "configure".  Have you installed any third-party kicker applets?

Thanks for your reply!
Leigh Willard
