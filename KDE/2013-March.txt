Hi ladies (and gentlemen) on this list,

The Akademy program committee is still looking for talk proposals for
Akademy 2013. The detailed CfP can be found here:
http://akademy2013.kde.org/cfp

The deadline for proposals is this Friday. Please consider submitting
a proposal, even if you haven't done so before. This is your chance to
present your application, share ideas and best practices, or gain new
contributors. A cordial environment with people who want you to
succeed. Don't be shy :).

Thanks and looking forward to seeing many of you in Bilbao in July!
Claudia

PS. I'd like to organize another Women's BoF - if you have ideas or
just want to attend, ping me.

Hej everyone,

I subscribed today to this list to combine two interests of mine.
-> I like and use open source software, especially KDE, so why shouldn't
I help in its development :).
-> I am interested in the female corner of this movement in general.
Huge mailing lists can also be quite a hassle :) so instead I would like
to ask in a smaller group:

As a phd student in bioinformatics (Hamburg/ Germany) my interests are
mostly centered around machine learning and parallel programming.
I am educated in the first and would like to find a project in the
second field to rise from beginners level to .. anything better :). I
dislike GUI development but am a "resource" if somebody wants to check
her/his front end against visually impaired people because I am one.
Does anyone have an idea of a fitting KDE project for me?

Thanks for your answers!
Agnes

Hi Agnes,

Nice to have you here!
What do you mean with parallel programming exactly? There is probably
some multithreading stuff in kdelibs.
As for machine learning: There might be some for example in Simon
Listens. Or you could talk to the KDEGames team and see if there is
something in that direction for you.


Cheers
Lydia

Hi everyone,

KDE will ?- for the first time this year - participate in the
"Outreach Program for Women"[1]. This was originally started by GNOME,
but has also other participating organisations like Wikimedia,
Mozilla, Fedora and others.

With KDAB as our sponsor we will be offering one internship. This is
in no way only limited to coding, but includes user experience design,
graphic design, documentation, web development, marketing, translation
and other types of tasks needed to sustain a Free Software project.

Prerequisits for application: Any woman who has not previously
participated in an Outreach Program for Women or Google Summer of Code
internship is welcome to apply, provided she is available for a
full-time internship during this time period. This program is open to
anyone who identifies as a woman regardless of gender presentation or
assigned sex at birth. Genderqueer and genderfluid people are welcome
to apply.

The application deadline for candidates is already on May 1st, while
the program runs from June 17 to September 23.

Please all, suggest suitable tasks on this wiki page [2] and volunteer
to mentor. Feel free to contact me or Lydia for more information.


Regards, Myriam

Do you need anything from us as developers?

GSOC student?

I would suggest adding on the KDE wiki page instructions on how to
apply, linking to the relevant bit of the Gnome wiki. As I understand
it they are to email  opw-list at gnome.org, how do these get back to us?

Not exactly, as the OPW is not aimed at students only, and it can also
be abvout projects not related to coding directly. So if you have a
task suggestion that is little or not at all about code and more about
all the rest of work that needs to be done in KDE, please add it to
the wiki page.

The OPW admins will forward them. But yes, I will add the links for
that, good point.

Before they actually send the application they have to get in touch
with us and make a contribution, as it will be part of their
application.

Hej Lydia,

Thanks for your answer.

On the long term openMPI, openAcc would be nice.
On the base level I would appreciate learning how to program parallel
algorithms and debug them. A project where I would like to contribute
would be quite a motivation to work through the study book lying on my
desk since weeks.

Oh thanks for stating the obvious :). I didn't know that some projects I
have heard of are actually in kdelibs.

I haven't heard of that at all. Thanks for it already in general.

Looking forward to contributing
Agnes

Hey :)

Just in case you're unsure about what kind of ideas to propose...
Wikimedia has taken part in the last round and the interns worked on
such things as
* release management
* organizing bug triage days
* making an inventory of MediaWiki consultants/companies
* documenting noteworthy templates on-wiki
* writing an extension
* creating designs and workflows for a new project

Much more is possible. This is your chance to get some important work
done ;-)  Add ideas to the ideas page please.


Cheers
Lydia
