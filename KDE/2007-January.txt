SCALE To Host Women in Open Source Mini Conference

(PressZoom) - The Southern California Linux Expo announces plans to 
host a 'Women In Open Source' Mini-conference.

The Southern California Linux Expo announces plans to host a 'Women 
In Open Source' Mini-conference. The goals of the conference are to 
encourage women to use technology and open source and free software, 
and to explore the obstacles that women face in breaking into the 
technology industry.

The audience will be those women who may have an interest in 
technology, but hesitate to get into it because they believe it's a 
male-only club. The conference will be held in conjunction with the 
Fifth Annual So Cal Linux Expo. The Women in Open Source 
mini-conference will be held February 9th, 2007 at the Westin LAX 
Hotel.

If you are interested in speaking, there are still speaker slots 
available. Contact Gareth Greenaway with your talk proposal.
