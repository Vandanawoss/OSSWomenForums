Hi dear kde-women,

in the new chill-out room kde-cafe a discussion started which gets rather=

heated. Since it's about us, you maybe want to join :-) The headline is=20
"Locker-room mentality in KDE?"...

You can read the archive at=20
http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-cafe/2002-April/thread.html#1702

You don't have to subscribe to the mailinglist in order to post and you c=

representatives for KDE. Fortunately the community and also the range of=20
opinions is much larger :-)

See you there or let's discuss it here,
eva

Don't get angry :) We all (and a lot of men) know, that there is no such
locker-room mentality. I think we should be happy about the positive
statements on that list and ignore the stupid comments :)

KDE-women is a great project -- I'm glad I met so many women all over
the world who share the same interest ;)

Good night, Heike

Message-ID: <200204111710.MAA13129@dragonwind.net>

I think that some of you might know if Eriksson t65/t68 gsm works with Kandy. 
I tried it, but only message is "cannot open device /dev/ttyS0" (same message 
for me nd root.)
I'm usually online with gprs with my laptop using another software (Mikko 
Rapelli's) and it works. I'd like to use Kandy to sync phonenumbers etc... If 
it is possible.

not really, google looks very unpromising. There's 3 hits, a pastor's 
guestbook, an announcement of a speech her husband's gonna deliver & an 
incredibly large PDF about interfaith ministries. Not so helpful, huh?

Kind regards,

Amy

Not really...

It was actually Bob Rea who mentioned Pauline Leet not Tink. Here is what he 
said that made me curious:

"And thanks for this discussion. I consider myself a male 
feminist for two reasons. The first is that I was 
introduced to primal modern feminism by one of the original 
people. In college i was involved in the civil rights 
movement in the USA. When I returned to visit two years 
after graduation, one of the older people I knew, a faculty 
wife, sat me down and told me what she had discovered. She 
had seen that women were oppressed much as black folk were 
in US society. She coined a word for it based on the term 
'racism.' namely, 'sexism.' Yes, she was the one who first 
named and described it, Pauline Leet, in 1967. So i learned 
it from the source."

Basically I know only a few famous feminists (apart from many the not so 
famous, but still hard working feminists ;-). The one I know most about is 
the german Alice Schwarzer who's is running a german feminist magazine.

Cheers,
eva

I could recommend a couple books to you to remedy that situation ;-)

Yes, that would be great :-) The best would be some kind of novel, since I 
already have to read many "Sachbücher" (specialized books) at work ;-)

BTW, I saw that your band is often on tour - do you also plan to come to 
Darmstadt or close to Darmstadt soon? Would be great to visit a concert :-)

Cheers, 
eva
