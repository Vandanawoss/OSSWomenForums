Hello all,

It's pretty exciting starting gnome women...and a webpage would
definitely help with communication and promotion.  I'd like to take on
the task of designing a site but before I begin, it would be great to
get suggestions concerning what to include and whatnot.

If someone wants to come up with content, that would also be cool.

One of my ideas is to include an area for bios.  I think that would be
pretty useful in getting to know each other and for newcomers in
figuring out who to contact. =)

Diana

Hi,

I just read about the Gnome Women movement on Footnotes and although I've
posted comments there, I thought it would be prudent to send this email and
let everybody know that I am offering two of my servers to host the HOWTO
written by many of the women in the computer industry. 

Original:
http://infohost.nmt.edu/~val/howto.html

Mirrors:
http://www.kennethpaul.com/Encourage-Women-in-Linux-HOWTO.html
http://www.makeitfast.com/Encourage-Women-in-Linux-HOWTO.html

Also, if there is any other assistance I may be able to provide, I'd like to
extend my offer of help. While I know this is mainly for women helping other
women get into the industry, it may be helpful for everyone to have
like-minded men available to show newcomers that there are guys out there
that are more than willing to help promote and encourage them where needed.

Congratulations on taking the first steps, and I look forward to seeing the
success of Gnome Women.

- Ken

Hello GNOME Women! I am not a woman. I am here to ask you to consider
becoming involved with marketing GNOME. See #marketing, #gnome-journal
and http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam. I think we really need a more
gender-balanced view.

cheers,

John

Hi Diana & All,

I think we all need to have a discussion about the specific goals we'd
like to achieve and tailor the website towards supporting that.

My thoughts were that the website, at the least, should serve as sort
of a professional-looking "business card" that we could advertise to
say university comp sci depts to try to recruit more women.

Bios I agree are also important; we should make it really easy for
people to contact us, making our irc names and email addys visible, as
well as our time zones and areas of specialty. :).

I think in the meantime though, while we are sorting out and defining
our goals, we could work on a logo. I think the most popular idea is
to emulate the debian-women venus logo, incorporating the gnome "G"
foot rather than the debian swirl. There have been ideas involving
"making up" the foot, e.g. nail polish, toe rings, lipstick, etc., and
I think a lot of them could be cute, but I'm worried about such logos
conveying the wrong idea about the project. We want to be taken
seriously, bottom-line.

Hi Máirín, hi everyone!

> I think we all need to have a discussion about the specific goals we'd
> like to achieve and tailor the website towards supporting that.

I agree. I think our high-level goal is pretty simple: "Encourage more
women to get involved in GNOME development."

There are a number of ways we can go about this. Personally, I'd like
to see GNOME Women be an action-oriented group. Primarily
support-based groups do (of course) serve a purpose, but I'm not
convinced that this isthe best way to actually increase women's
involvement in free software projects.

I think it's worth considering some of the things that the Debian
Women project has found to be successful, and adopting a similar
strategy. Some possible things to aim for would be:

* Role models. Greater visibility of active women.
* Mentoring.
* Tutorials held on IRC.
* Bug-squashing parties.
* Creating opportunities for collaborating with existing GNOME
  developers.
* Organising BOFs and giving talks at Linux conferences.
* Actively encouraging and educating the GNOME community to increase
  understanding of the issues facing women who wish to get more
  involved in GNOME development.

Obviously, this list of activities is likely to evolve (and hopefully
grow!) as GNOME Women becomes larger, but I think these things are a
good starting point for discussion, planning and action.

That sounds like a decent idea. I think the website should also serve
as a starting point for women interested in getting more involved with
GNOME. In other words, I think that tutorials, FAQs, ways people can
get involved etc. are all good things to have on the site.

Absolutely!

I think that's a good starting point. Do we have any graphic designers
on the list? If so, this'd be a great time to step forwards. :-)

I very much agree with this. Projects aimed at getting more women
involved in technology development are rarely taken seriously by the
existing development community, whatever it may be, if there is too
much emphasis on "cutesy" and stereotypically feminine logos etc. I'd
like to think we're about breaking stereotypes, not reinforcing them!

Hi everyone,

This is Runa from India. I am part of the bengali localisation team
(www.bengalinux.org) and have so far contributed to Gnome, Fedora, Xfce
and Mozilla l10n projects. I use either runa or runab on the irc. Came
across this forum a few days back and its really encouraging to see
women carving out a place for themselves and making their efforts
visible, as more often than not in techincal domains we are pushed back
as non-serious players inspite of noteworthy contributions.

Perhaps a logo that doesnt really scream "we are females" and portrays
the fact that we are "professionals, know what we are doing and we r
good at it too" might help. 

just my 2 cents :)

Hi,

Quick introduction:

I'm a woman, and I'm genuinely interested in being part of GNOME women,
probably as a development mentee (I'm a programmer, but not familiar
with GNOME libraries, the HIG etc). My FOSS involvement to date has
been doing some documentation development for the Twisted community. In
addition, I've been heavily involved in my local LUG at times and have a
fairly high involvement in the LinuxChix community.

So, moving on... can I join the IRC channel on GIMPnet? This morning I
got 
--- Cannot join #gnome-women (Channel is invite only).
Fele free to contact me off-list with details. (And assume I can, is
there some way I can avoid having to ask to be reinvited every 24 hours?
I log off IRC at night.)

-Mary

Hi Mary,

There was some confusion earlier and it got set +i by accident. I've
fixed it so you (and anyone else who's run into this problem) can join
now.

Indeed. I'm sorry about that. (Not quite sure how it happened, but
we'll try to ensure it doesn't happen again!)

Hi people, 

I recently found out about Getting Involved
(http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam_2fGettingInvolved), the GNOME
Marketing Team's new project, which aims to provide (better)
information on getting involved in GNOME. Some of the things they plan
to do include:

* Look for the more inclusive concept of "contributors" rather than
  the more restricted term "developers".

* Make sure programmers understand why GNOME is a great platform and
  community to develop software, where the help is needed and how to
  start contributing.

* Make sure that all willing contributors but non-programmers
  understand as well that there is a place for them and a plenty of
  exciting things to do and share.

Sounds like this is something highly relevant to GNOME Women, and
worth keeping an eye on, if not contributing to.

Regards,

As a very new Gnome-Woman who has just crawled in the door <peels off =20=

shrinkwrap, itchy..> I think this sounds like an exciting and =20
possibly overdue move.

We'll certainly get much more participation, and a broader range of =20
it, if people know that anything positive and useful is welcomed. We =20
need to get out of people's heads (including our own) the thoughts =20
"I'm only a user", "I only do patches sometimes", "I'm only a =20
translator" "I could only run a discussion group, I don't really know =20=

anything" which really hold back people from contributing their =20
definitely valuable skills and experience.

I hope it works well. :)  I'll start inside my head: it needs =20
updating badly.

Hey Everybody,

We need a logo for the Gnome Women project! So, we're running a contest
for logo ideas. Even if you are not artistically inclined, submit your
idea and we'll discuss it on the list! If you are, that's cool too; you
can post the URL to your logo on list or just attach it to your email.
We'll decide on our favorites on-list and Diana and/or I will finalize
any work that needs to be done graphically.

We'll give two weeks for submissions, so the due date for submissions
is: Friday, Jul 15th. You can reply to this message with your submission
(s).

Some things to keep in mind when creating your logo:

o The current 'mission statement' of the Gnome Women project is: "GNOME
Women is a project to (1) provide encouragement for women to contribute
to GNOME (2) make visible the GNOME contributors who are women."

o Let's try not to reinforce too many gender stereotypes. It's hard, I
know.

o You can get an svg versios of the GNOME logo at:
http://linuxgrrl.com/gnomewomen/gnome2-fancy-pat.svg
(Normally there are multiple versions available at
http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/random/logo/ but the gnome servers were just
relocated physically and it looks like some stuff is still down.)

o Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org/) and sodipodi
(http://www.sodipodi.com/) are really nice vector graphics programs
suitable for creating vector logos in GNOME. ;-)

Hmmm, one brainstorm style idea (as in, I haven't thought about the
graphics difficulty):  a stylised woman martial artist kicking straight
at the viewer. Her foot is the GNOME foot.

Hello all,

It's pretty exciting starting gnome women...and a webpage would
definitely help with communication and promotion.  I'd like to take on
the task of designing a site but before I begin, it would be great to
get suggestions concerning what to include and whatnot.

If someone wants to come up with content, that would also be cool.

One of my ideas is to include an area for bios.  I think that would be
pretty useful in getting to know each other and for newcomers in
figuring out who to contact. =)

Diana

Hi,

I just read about the Gnome Women movement on Footnotes and although I've
posted comments there, I thought it would be prudent to send this email and
let everybody know that I am offering two of my servers to host the HOWTO
written by many of the women in the computer industry. 

Original:
http://infohost.nmt.edu/~val/howto.html

Mirrors:
http://www.kennethpaul.com/Encourage-Women-in-Linux-HOWTO.html
http://www.makeitfast.com/Encourage-Women-in-Linux-HOWTO.html

Also, if there is any other assistance I may be able to provide, I'd like to
extend my offer of help. While I know this is mainly for women helping other
women get into the industry, it may be helpful for everyone to have
like-minded men available to show newcomers that there are guys out there
that are more than willing to help promote and encourage them where needed.

Congratulations on taking the first steps, and I look forward to seeing the
success of Gnome Women.

- Ken

Hello GNOME Women! I am not a woman. I am here to ask you to consider
becoming involved with marketing GNOME. See #marketing, #gnome-journal
and http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam. I think we really need a more
gender-balanced view.

cheers,

John

Hi Diana & All,

I think we all need to have a discussion about the specific goals we'd
like to achieve and tailor the website towards supporting that.

My thoughts were that the website, at the least, should serve as sort
of a professional-looking "business card" that we could advertise to
say university comp sci depts to try to recruit more women.

Bios I agree are also important; we should make it really easy for
people to contact us, making our irc names and email addys visible, as
well as our time zones and areas of specialty. :).

I think in the meantime though, while we are sorting out and defining
our goals, we could work on a logo. I think the most popular idea is
to emulate the debian-women venus logo, incorporating the gnome "G"
foot rather than the debian swirl. There have been ideas involving
"making up" the foot, e.g. nail polish, toe rings, lipstick, etc., and
I think a lot of them could be cute, but I'm worried about such logos
conveying the wrong idea about the project. We want to be taken
seriously, bottom-line.

Hi Máirín, hi everyone!

> I think we all need to have a discussion about the specific goals we'd
> like to achieve and tailor the website towards supporting that.

I agree. I think our high-level goal is pretty simple: "Encourage more
women to get involved in GNOME development."

There are a number of ways we can go about this. Personally, I'd like
to see GNOME Women be an action-oriented group. Primarily
support-based groups do (of course) serve a purpose, but I'm not
convinced that this isthe best way to actually increase women's
involvement in free software projects.

I think it's worth considering some of the things that the Debian
Women project has found to be successful, and adopting a similar
strategy. Some possible things to aim for would be:

* Role models. Greater visibility of active women.
* Mentoring.
* Tutorials held on IRC.
* Bug-squashing parties.
* Creating opportunities for collaborating with existing GNOME
  developers.
* Organising BOFs and giving talks at Linux conferences.
* Actively encouraging and educating the GNOME community to increase
  understanding of the issues facing women who wish to get more
  involved in GNOME development.

Obviously, this list of activities is likely to evolve (and hopefully
grow!) as GNOME Women becomes larger, but I think these things are a
good starting point for discussion, planning and action.

That sounds like a decent idea. I think the website should also serve
as a starting point for women interested in getting more involved with
GNOME. In other words, I think that tutorials, FAQs, ways people can
get involved etc. are all good things to have on the site.

Absolutely!

I think that's a good starting point. Do we have any graphic designers
on the list? If so, this'd be a great time to step forwards. :-)

I very much agree with this. Projects aimed at getting more women
involved in technology development are rarely taken seriously by the
existing development community, whatever it may be, if there is too
much emphasis on "cutesy" and stereotypically feminine logos etc. I'd
like to think we're about breaking stereotypes, not reinforcing them!

Hi everyone,

This is Runa from India. I am part of the bengali localisation team
(www.bengalinux.org) and have so far contributed to Gnome, Fedora, Xfce
and Mozilla l10n projects. I use either runa or runab on the irc. Came
across this forum a few days back and its really encouraging to see
women carving out a place for themselves and making their efforts
visible, as more often than not in techincal domains we are pushed back
as non-serious players inspite of noteworthy contributions.

Perhaps a logo that doesnt really scream "we are females" and portrays
the fact that we are "professionals, know what we are doing and we r
good at it too" might help. 

just my 2 cents :)

Hi,

Quick introduction:

I'm a woman, and I'm genuinely interested in being part of GNOME women,
probably as a development mentee (I'm a programmer, but not familiar
with GNOME libraries, the HIG etc). My FOSS involvement to date has
been doing some documentation development for the Twisted community. In
addition, I've been heavily involved in my local LUG at times and have a
fairly high involvement in the LinuxChix community.

So, moving on... can I join the IRC channel on GIMPnet? This morning I
got 
--- Cannot join #gnome-women (Channel is invite only).
Fele free to contact me off-list with details. (And assume I can, is
there some way I can avoid having to ask to be reinvited every 24 hours?
I log off IRC at night.)

-Mary

Hi Mary,

There was some confusion earlier and it got set +i by accident. I've
fixed it so you (and anyone else who's run into this problem) can join
now.

Indeed. I'm sorry about that. (Not quite sure how it happened, but
we'll try to ensure it doesn't happen again!)

Hi people, 

I recently found out about Getting Involved
(http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam_2fGettingInvolved), the GNOME
Marketing Team's new project, which aims to provide (better)
information on getting involved in GNOME. Some of the things they plan
to do include:

* Look for the more inclusive concept of "contributors" rather than
  the more restricted term "developers".

* Make sure programmers understand why GNOME is a great platform and
  community to develop software, where the help is needed and how to
  start contributing.

* Make sure that all willing contributors but non-programmers
  understand as well that there is a place for them and a plenty of
  exciting things to do and share.

Sounds like this is something highly relevant to GNOME Women, and
worth keeping an eye on, if not contributing to.

Regards,

As a very new Gnome-Woman who has just crawled in the door <peels off =20=

shrinkwrap, itchy..> I think this sounds like an exciting and =20
possibly overdue move.

We'll certainly get much more participation, and a broader range of =20
it, if people know that anything positive and useful is welcomed. We =20
need to get out of people's heads (including our own) the thoughts =20
"I'm only a user", "I only do patches sometimes", "I'm only a =20
translator" "I could only run a discussion group, I don't really know =20=

anything" which really hold back people from contributing their =20
definitely valuable skills and experience.

I hope it works well. :)  I'll start inside my head: it needs =20
updating badly.

Hey Everybody,

We need a logo for the Gnome Women project! So, we're running a contest
for logo ideas. Even if you are not artistically inclined, submit your
idea and we'll discuss it on the list! If you are, that's cool too; you
can post the URL to your logo on list or just attach it to your email.
We'll decide on our favorites on-list and Diana and/or I will finalize
any work that needs to be done graphically.

We'll give two weeks for submissions, so the due date for submissions
is: Friday, Jul 15th. You can reply to this message with your submission
(s).

Some things to keep in mind when creating your logo:

o The current 'mission statement' of the Gnome Women project is: "GNOME
Women is a project to (1) provide encouragement for women to contribute
to GNOME (2) make visible the GNOME contributors who are women."

o Let's try not to reinforce too many gender stereotypes. It's hard, I
know.

o You can get an svg versios of the GNOME logo at:
http://linuxgrrl.com/gnomewomen/gnome2-fancy-pat.svg
(Normally there are multiple versions available at
http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/random/logo/ but the gnome servers were just
relocated physically and it looks like some stuff is still down.)

o Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org/) and sodipodi
(http://www.sodipodi.com/) are really nice vector graphics programs
suitable for creating vector logos in GNOME. ;-)

Hmmm, one brainstorm style idea (as in, I haven't thought about the
graphics difficulty):  a stylised woman martial artist kicking straight
at the viewer. Her foot is the GNOME foot.

Hello all,

It's pretty exciting starting gnome women...and a webpage would
definitely help with communication and promotion.  I'd like to take on
the task of designing a site but before I begin, it would be great to
get suggestions concerning what to include and whatnot.

If someone wants to come up with content, that would also be cool.

One of my ideas is to include an area for bios.  I think that would be
pretty useful in getting to know each other and for newcomers in
figuring out who to contact. =)

Diana

Hi,

I just read about the Gnome Women movement on Footnotes and although I've
posted comments there, I thought it would be prudent to send this email and
let everybody know that I am offering two of my servers to host the HOWTO
written by many of the women in the computer industry. 

Original:
http://infohost.nmt.edu/~val/howto.html

Mirrors:
http://www.kennethpaul.com/Encourage-Women-in-Linux-HOWTO.html
http://www.makeitfast.com/Encourage-Women-in-Linux-HOWTO.html

Also, if there is any other assistance I may be able to provide, I'd like to
extend my offer of help. While I know this is mainly for women helping other
women get into the industry, it may be helpful for everyone to have
like-minded men available to show newcomers that there are guys out there
that are more than willing to help promote and encourage them where needed.

Congratulations on taking the first steps, and I look forward to seeing the
success of Gnome Women.

- Ken

Hello GNOME Women! I am not a woman. I am here to ask you to consider
becoming involved with marketing GNOME. See #marketing, #gnome-journal
and http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam. I think we really need a more
gender-balanced view.

cheers,

John

Hi Diana & All,

I think we all need to have a discussion about the specific goals we'd
like to achieve and tailor the website towards supporting that.

My thoughts were that the website, at the least, should serve as sort
of a professional-looking "business card" that we could advertise to
say university comp sci depts to try to recruit more women.

Bios I agree are also important; we should make it really easy for
people to contact us, making our irc names and email addys visible, as
well as our time zones and areas of specialty. :).

I think in the meantime though, while we are sorting out and defining
our goals, we could work on a logo. I think the most popular idea is
to emulate the debian-women venus logo, incorporating the gnome "G"
foot rather than the debian swirl. There have been ideas involving
"making up" the foot, e.g. nail polish, toe rings, lipstick, etc., and
I think a lot of them could be cute, but I'm worried about such logos
conveying the wrong idea about the project. We want to be taken
seriously, bottom-line.

Hi Máirín, hi everyone!

> I think we all need to have a discussion about the specific goals we'd
> like to achieve and tailor the website towards supporting that.

I agree. I think our high-level goal is pretty simple: "Encourage more
women to get involved in GNOME development."

There are a number of ways we can go about this. Personally, I'd like
to see GNOME Women be an action-oriented group. Primarily
support-based groups do (of course) serve a purpose, but I'm not
convinced that this isthe best way to actually increase women's
involvement in free software projects.

I think it's worth considering some of the things that the Debian
Women project has found to be successful, and adopting a similar
strategy. Some possible things to aim for would be:

* Role models. Greater visibility of active women.
* Mentoring.
* Tutorials held on IRC.
* Bug-squashing parties.
* Creating opportunities for collaborating with existing GNOME
  developers.
* Organising BOFs and giving talks at Linux conferences.
* Actively encouraging and educating the GNOME community to increase
  understanding of the issues facing women who wish to get more
  involved in GNOME development.

Obviously, this list of activities is likely to evolve (and hopefully
grow!) as GNOME Women becomes larger, but I think these things are a
good starting point for discussion, planning and action. 

> My thoughts were that the website, at the least, should serve as sort

That sounds like a decent idea. I think the website should also serve
as a starting point for women interested in getting more involved with
GNOME. In other words, I think that tutorials, FAQs, ways people can
get involved etc. are all good things to have on the site.

> Bios I agree are also important; we should make it really easy for

Absolutely!

I think that's a good starting point. Do we have any graphic designers
on the list? If so, this'd be a great time to step forwards. :-)

I very much agree with this. Projects aimed at getting more women
involved in technology development are rarely taken seriously by the
existing development community, whatever it may be, if there is too
much emphasis on "cutesy" and stereotypically feminine logos etc. I'd
like to think we're about breaking stereotypes, not reinforcing them!

Hi everyone,

This is Runa from India. I am part of the bengali localisation team
(www.bengalinux.org) and have so far contributed to Gnome, Fedora, Xfce
and Mozilla l10n projects. I use either runa or runab on the irc. Came
across this forum a few days back and its really encouraging to see
women carving out a place for themselves and making their efforts
visible, as more often than not in techincal domains we are pushed back
as non-serious players inspite of noteworthy contributions.

Perhaps a logo that doesnt really scream "we are females" and portrays
the fact that we are "professionals, know what we are doing and we r
good at it too" might help. 

just my 2 cents :)

Hi,

Quick introduction:

I'm a woman, and I'm genuinely interested in being part of GNOME women,
probably as a development mentee (I'm a programmer, but not familiar
with GNOME libraries, the HIG etc). My FOSS involvement to date has
been doing some documentation development for the Twisted community. In
addition, I've been heavily involved in my local LUG at times and have a
fairly high involvement in the LinuxChix community.

So, moving on... can I join the IRC channel on GIMPnet? This morning I
got 
--- Cannot join #gnome-women (Channel is invite only).
Fele free to contact me off-list with details. (And assume I can, is
there some way I can avoid having to ask to be reinvited every 24 hours?
I log off IRC at night.)

-Mary

Hi Mary,

There was some confusion earlier and it got set +i by accident. I've
fixed it so you (and anyone else who's run into this problem) can join
now.

Indeed. I'm sorry about that. (Not quite sure how it happened, but
we'll try to ensure it doesn't happen again!)

Hi people, 

I recently found out about Getting Involved
(http://live.gnome.org/MarketingTeam_2fGettingInvolved), the GNOME
Marketing Team's new project, which aims to provide (better)
information on getting involved in GNOME. Some of the things they plan
to do include:

* Look for the more inclusive concept of "contributors" rather than
  the more restricted term "developers".

* Make sure programmers understand why GNOME is a great platform and
  community to develop software, where the help is needed and how to
  start contributing.

* Make sure that all willing contributors but non-programmers
  understand as well that there is a place for them and a plenty of
  exciting things to do and share.

Sounds like this is something highly relevant to GNOME Women, and
worth keeping an eye on, if not contributing to.

Regards,

As a very new Gnome-Woman who has just crawled in the door <peels off =20=

shrinkwrap, itchy..> I think this sounds like an exciting and =20
possibly overdue move.

We'll certainly get much more participation, and a broader range of =20
it, if people know that anything positive and useful is welcomed. We =20
need to get out of people's heads (including our own) the thoughts =20
"I'm only a user", "I only do patches sometimes", "I'm only a =20
translator" "I could only run a discussion group, I don't really know =20=

anything" which really hold back people from contributing their =20
definitely valuable skills and experience.

I hope it works well. :)  I'll start inside my head: it needs =20
updating badly.

Hey Everybody,

We need a logo for the Gnome Women project! So, we're running a contest
for logo ideas. Even if you are not artistically inclined, submit your
idea and we'll discuss it on the list! If you are, that's cool too; you
can post the URL to your logo on list or just attach it to your email.
We'll decide on our favorites on-list and Diana and/or I will finalize
any work that needs to be done graphically.

We'll give two weeks for submissions, so the due date for submissions
is: Friday, Jul 15th. You can reply to this message with your submission
(s).

Some things to keep in mind when creating your logo:

o The current 'mission statement' of the Gnome Women project is: "GNOME
Women is a project to (1) provide encouragement for women to contribute
to GNOME (2) make visible the GNOME contributors who are women."

o Let's try not to reinforce too many gender stereotypes. It's hard, I
know.

o You can get an svg versios of the GNOME logo at:
http://linuxgrrl.com/gnomewomen/gnome2-fancy-pat.svg
(Normally there are multiple versions available at
http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/random/logo/ but the gnome servers were just
relocated physically and it looks like some stuff is still down.)

o Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org/) and sodipodi
(http://www.sodipodi.com/) are really nice vector graphics programs
suitable for creating vector logos in GNOME. ;-)

Hmmm, one brainstorm style idea (as in, I haven't thought about the
graphics difficulty):  a stylised woman martial artist kicking straight
at the viewer. Her foot is the GNOME foot.
