PyCon 2007, a conference focusing on the Python programming language,
is looking for proposals for the conference's formal presentation
tracks.  The conference will take place February 23-25 2007 in
Addison, Texas.

For 2007, we're especially interested in tutorial presentations that
will teach conference-goers something new and useful. Can you show
attendees how to: use a particular module? explore a Python language
feature? write or package an application?

The deadline for submitting a proposal is October 31st.  
For more information, see the Call For Proposals at
<http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/CallForProposals>.

We're also accepting proposals for three-hour tutorials for the day
before the conference.  Tutorials are extra-cost for attendees, and
tutorial presenters receive a portion of the proceeds.  Some of last
year's tutorials were:

       * Python 102
       * Getting Started with wxPython
       * Text and Data Processing
       * Plone Rapid Bootcamp
       * Using Databases with Python

Tutorial proposals can be submitted through e-mail; please see
<http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/CallForTutorials> for information.
