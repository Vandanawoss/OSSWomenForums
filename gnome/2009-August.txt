The Free Software Foundation will host a mini-summit on Women in Free
Software to discuss how the free software community can cultivate and
increase participation by women in free software's development and
activism communities.

BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Monday, August 24th, 2009 -- On
September 19, 2009, Deborah Nicholson of the Free Software Foundation
(FSF), Stormy Peters of the GNOME Foundation and Hillary Rettig, free
software activist and author of The Lifelong Activist, will gather a
small group of women activists, thinkers, and scholars to identify
strategies and initiatives that will foster sustained participation by
women in the movement.

As organizations representing an international movement to bring free
software and freedom to everyone, the FSF and GNOME Foundation are
seeking practical initiatives to increase the participation of women
in the movement. Historically, women have been underrepresented in the
technology and free software communities, and despite recent increases
in the adoption of free software, the situation has not significantly
improved. Deborah Nicholson said, "At the summit, we will discuss
existing entry points, why women don't always feel invited, and when
they do, why they don't always stay. Individual projects have found
ways to make women welcome and we will look at some of these examples
and discuss how to build on those successes. We will also identify new
strategies and tactics to help create a balanced community."

Stormy Peters said, "The Women in Free Software mini-summit will be an
opportunity to discuss how the FSF and the GNOME Foundation can work
with the free software community to more effectively encourage women
to participate, and to make policy and program recommendations to the
FSF and the wider community to further this goal."
About the Free Software Foundation

The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to
promoting computer users' right to use, study, copy, modify, and
redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development and
use of free (as in freedom) software -- particularly the GNU operating
system and its GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation for free
software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and
political issues of freedom in the use of software, and its Web sites,
located at fsf.org and gnu.org, are an important source of information
about GNU/Linux. Donations to support the FSF's work can be made at
http://donate.fsf.org. Its headquarters are in Boston, MA, USA.

Hi!

The broader free software community has restarted the discussion about women participation in open source by a series of interviews in the ROSE Blog [1], plans to host a women in free software mini-summit [2], and approaching the GNOME project about running another women outreach program [3].

Running another women outreach program is a very concrete way of getting more women contributors, and I'd like to ask you to review the current ideas for the program on the wiki and share any feedback you have.

http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram

This also sounds like a great time for re-vitalizing the Women in GNOME community. So I would like to propose we do a round of introductions. The first bullet point on the GnomeWomen wiki page is "providing role models by increasing the visibility of active women in GNOME" and I think it is a particularly effective way of attracting new contributors. By sharing what we love about our involvement in GNOME, we can show that it really is a women-friendly environment and serve as a starting point of contact for women who want to get involved.

Finally, please join the Women in GNOME group I created on Facebook:

http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=118943919669

As for my introduction, I work as a software developer on the GNOME Shell project [4] at Red Hat. Working on the GNOME Shell is particularly exciting because it is the next generation of the GNOME desktop or GNOME 3. I get to code many parts of the desktop interface, weigh in on the design decisions, and make sure that our project is friendly to new contributors by updating the wiki and offering answers to anything I know about on IRC. Because GNOME Shell is a community project, I get to work with people from Red Hat and with anyone from the GNOME community who decides to contribute. Everyone is top-notch and motivated, and while people have strong opinions, they are generally polite. I have recently started blogging [5], and hope to keep my blog updated with the GNOME Shell news and posts that will encourage women to get involved in GNOME.

Now it's your turn :)!

Marina

Well, the one thing that I thought of is it's programming-centric. If
it's going to be based on GNOME shell you might want a designer or a
docs writer maybe? Just an idea.

Unfortunately I'm not quite as involved in GNOME as I used to be, just
for lack of time. :( I'm an interaction designer with Red Hat and I do a
lot of UI mockups, user research, and sometimes marketing stuff too.
Lately I've been really involved in doing these things for Fedora
specifically (although when I do rich-client mockups they are always for
GNOME using the HIG :) ), but in the past I have worked on things like
the GNOME brand book and template for the site that's currently in use
at gnome.org, and some various artworks and things like that. 

As a designer my favorite thing about GNOME is the design awareness that
is part of the community - rarely do I have to get any GNOME developers
I work with up-to-speed becaues they already know their stuff and
already recognize the value of design. I can dig in and get working
without having to argue design's case - folks are already sold. :)

Are there any designers or folks interested in design and usability on
the list?
