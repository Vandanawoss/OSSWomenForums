Hello all,

By way of introduction, I maintain GNU Guile, an implementation of the
Scheme programming language. My GNOME involvement started with work on
GStreamer, a media handling framework -- frustrated attempts to make
music, the common condition -- but I've moved more to the GNU side of
things now.

I'm writing this list because I'm organizing the upcoming GNU Hackers
Meeting, co-located with GUADEC this year, at the Hague, 24-25 July. The
weekend before, yes. I recently read the Leslie Hawthorne interview at
LWN.net -- http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/382813/3827d0dfb18605d9/ -- and
I realized I should be engaging with a GNU women's group to see about
getting speakers.

Except, there is no GNU women's group, and a cursory investigation of
the list of GNU maintainers pulls up no women. I didn't realize the
situation was this bad!

I guess I have two requests.

The first request is for speakers for the upcoming GHM. GNOME is part of
GNU if it wants to be -- see
http://wingolog.org/archives/2009/12/13/gnu-gnome-and-the-fsf -- and you
are very welcome to speak at the event.

Even if you are not really involved with GNU, please consider attending
the GHM. Speaking personally, it has been really enriching to become a
part of the OS that underlies most GNOME deployments. You will be most
welcome.

The second request is for people who feel identified with GNU in some
way to consider organizing a "GNU women's group". I would imagine that
the proper route is to choose someone that you trust as a maintainer,
then to contact RMS to set up a new GNU project. (Yes, I think it's that
important.) Please contact me if you are interested and have any
questions; I'm "wingo" on freenode and gimpnet IRC.

                                ***

A final thought, from a relative GNU newcomer: GNU culture is
interesting, similar to GNOME culture in many aspects, but different in
its own way. It's rooted in Stallman and MIT and old hackers and
visionaries. These roots affect the present, as with any organization
with a long history.

But because it's been male-dominated for so long, some "typically
masculine" elements might have infiltrated into that culture. RTFM-ness,
for example. I don't think these parts are in any essential; they're
trash, as you all well know. /=C3=81nimo, peregrina/; if you find this
element, rooting it out is the good fight.


Peace, and please, let's talk about the GHM!

Copy me on any replies, as I'm not on the list :)

Andy

Dear hackers,

The GNOME Foundation provides travel sponsorships to individuals=20
that want to attend GUADEC and need financial assistance.

We are happy to announce the Travel Committee is ready to receive
applications for sponsorships to attend to GUADEC 2010.  This year,
GUADEC is being held in the The Hague University, in The Hague,
Netherlands, from Monday 26th July, until Friday 30th July.

The instructions are detailed at http://live.gnome.org/Travel
Please read them carefully.

Deadline: April 27, 2009, 19:00 UTC.  You can start sending
your applications now!

Some additional comments:
* Any information you send to the Travel Committee will be private.
* Asking for sponsorship *does not* guarantee you will get sponsored.
* A good application with good information will be processed faster.
* If you need help with accommodation, the Travel Committee will book=20
  the hotel or hostel for you. This enables us to get group rates and=20
  provide accommodation assistance to the most people possible.
  You should state that you need accommodation, and leave the cost
  blank.
* Always choose the most economical option whenever possible.  People who=20
  need travel sponsorship, should look for the best price
  (i.e. through a service like kayak.com).  If the Travel Committee=20
  finds a cheaper price, that will be the price considered during the
  evaluation.
* If you are applying to a Google Summer of Code program (as student
  or mentor) you should mention it in your application. Preference will=20
  be given to students and mentors participating in the Google Summer=20
  of Code or the Outreach Program for Women.
  GSoC students usually get a percentage of their GUADEC expenses=20
  covered.
* If you submitted an abstract to be presented at GUADEC, you should
  mention it in your application.  Preference will be given to people=20
  giving presentations at GUADEC.
  The GUADEC paper committee will let the travel committee know which
  talks have been accepted, so as long as you let us know you submitted
  one, there is no need to follow up.
* The Travel committee should reply back about receiving your
  application within 2-3 days. After that we would accumulate all the
  sponsorship requests and process them together. So please do not panic
  (have any butterflies in your stomach) if we take some time to reply on
  the status. Affirmative/Negative you would surely get a response.
* No personal emails. Please keep travel-committee Cc'ed on all your=20
  replies.

You can find us in the #travel channel at irc.gnome.org.

Kind regards,

Hey all,

Just wondering who's going to GUADEC this year. Maybe we could have a
get together or something.
