Hi GNOME Women team!

I was wondering (and hoping!) if there was interest in doing another
GNOME Journal special edition written by the GNOME Women community later
this year.   I believe we had a lot of success with last year's edition
and I was hoping we could do it again.

I was thinking we could do it in the November time frame to give us time
to recruit authors and articles but other than that haven't spent a lot
of time thinking about the project timeline.

If there is interest, please let me know and I am happy to help in every
way I can.

Best,

Paul

The Taiwan local community just set up the Women's community after
GNOME.Asia 2010. If there will be some progress around November, might be
interesting to write some paragraph about Taiwan Women's activities.
