In computer science, a growing gender gap
Women shunning a field once seen as welcoming

By Marcella Bombardieri, Globe Staff  |  December 18, 2005

MEDFORD -- As a young high school teacher in 1982, Diane Souvaine leapt 
into graduate school for computer science having taken only one class in 
the subject.

Computers, she believed, offered an exhilarating way to apply her math 
skills to real-world problems. And because computer science was coming 
into its own in the feminist age, she also hoped it would be more 
welcoming to women than her undergraduate math department.

Today, Souvaine chairs the Tufts University computer science department, 
which has more female professors than male. But few younger women have 
followed in her generation's footsteps. Next spring, when 22 computer 
science graduates accept their Tufts diplomas, only four will be women.
