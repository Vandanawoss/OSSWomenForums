Hi, I don't usually post on this list (lurk), but I help organize an
open source conference in Chicago called Flourish. If any of you are
around here early April, and are interested, please check it out. The
conference is held in UIC and has a lot of the tech/geek community
here. For once, we (surprisingly) don't have a women in open source
talk, but we have a pretty interesting line-up of speakers, so please
check us out.

I hope you don't mind me posting this here...

More information below the sign off.

Hi all!

The eight GNOME Outreach Program for Women interns have just completed thei=
r internships! Congratulations to everyone on the job well done! We definit=
ely hope this was a great experience for you and you will stay involved in =
GNOME!

We have opened the application process for the new round of internships. Th=
e dates for these internships are May 23 to August 22, 2011. These dates ma=
tch the ones for the Google Summer of Code program, so I would like to enco=
urage women who qualify for Google Summer of Code to apply for both program=
s. Google Summer of Code requires applicants to be students applying for co=
ding projects, while Outreach Program for Women internships are open to non=
-students and non-coders. For example, three out of eight interns last roun=
d were non-students, and two others worked on the Documentation Project.

The application deadline is April 8, 2011. As part of the application proce=
ss, we are asking women to take the time to learn about the participating p=
rojects and make a small contribution to the one they are interested in. Th=
ese projects include ones in programming, graphic design, documentation, an=
d marketing.

All the program details are here:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2011

We also have an awesome flyer for the program that was designed and updated=
 by M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn Duffy:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2011?action=3DAttachFile&do=
=3Dview&target=3Dgnome-women-outreach-poster_2011.png

Please consider applying for the internship, signing up as a mentor, or hel=
ping us spread the word! Send the information about the program to the univ=
ersities and organizations, post the flyer on the university campuses or ha=
nd it out at conferences, encourage anyone who'd be a good candidate to app=
ly, or write an update on Identi.ca, Twitter or Facebook!

All the materials for helping us spread the word are here:

Thank you!
Marina
