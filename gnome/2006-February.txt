Hi everyone :)

Sorry I haven't been participating: I was out of action for some =20
time, then had to catch up on a lot of translation. The string-freeze =20=

_should_ free me up a bit.

I'm sorry I missed our Bug Day, but hope to contribute to the next =20
get-together via computer (I can't get around any other way ;) ).

Mary, if we do have a translation session, we could make it =20
translation/documentation. There's a lot of work needed to be done by =20=

people in English, before we can effectively translate the results. =20
At least some of the docs need updating/checking. Christian could =20
probably give us a good view on that.

I've copied a message here, inviting a couple of new female =20
translators to join. Hope that's OK.

Also hoping things are going as well as possible for you all. :)

Hi everyone :)

Sorry I haven't been participating: I was out of action for some =20
time, then had to catch up on a lot of translation. The string-freeze =20=

_should_ free me up a bit.

I'm sorry I missed our Bug Day, but hope to contribute to the next =20
get-together via computer (I can't get around any other way ;) ).

Mary, if we do have a translation session, we could make it =20
translation/documentation. There's a lot of work needed to be done by =20=

people in English, before we can effectively translate the results. =20
At least some of the docs need updating/checking. Christian could =20
probably give us a good view on that.

I've copied a message here, inviting a couple of new female =20
translators to join. Hope that's OK.

Also hoping things are going as well as possible for you all. :)
