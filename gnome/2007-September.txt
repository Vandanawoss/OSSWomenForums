Hello, ladies!

We've been getting ads of all kinds of interesting events lately, and
I've been cross-forwarding them to another small network of women in
technology. Is there, by any chance, a blog or news site on these kinds
of events somewhere, so that we could do some centralized advertising
through it via e.g. RSS feeds? 

If not, anyone interested in starting one up? I have a blog service
available at the university, but the problem there is that I would be
the only one able to post on it, and I'm often too busy to keep track of
these kinds of events. I'd therefore rather see either a more
community-driveable site or a blog by someone who is into blogging
themselves. :) Would this be something we should try to get Sourceforge
or a similar larger site to offer on the side? 

--Sini seldom goes to these events, just advertises them. X-)

The Sixth Annual SoCal Linux Expo will be February 8th-10th, 2008. It=20
will again be at the Westin LAX. SCALE has reserved more of the hotel=20
resources for SCALE 6X which will help address some of the seminar=20
crowding issues that arose during S5X (success is a nice problem to have).

Over the last two SCALEs, the Expo has expanded to included specialized=20

Demonstrating Open Source Health Care Systems, returns for a second=20
time. Last year DOHCS was a single track. For SCALE 6X, DOHCS splits=20
into two tracks, a technical track and a business track.

Open=20

If you have any experience in any of the above-mentioned areas, please=20

speaker slots filled rapidly; we anticipate the same for SCALE 6X. So if=20
you're considering speaking, don't delay submitting your proposal.=20
Submittal info for each conference can be found on their respective CFP=20
pages.

If your organization is considering a booth on the SCALE Expo floor, be=20
advised that we no more booths than last year, and last year they went=20

one NOW. If you're a non-profit group, complete the application form at=20

The second SCALE IRC chat will be September 16th , at 7:00 pm PST. It=20
will be held in the #scale-chat channel of OFTC (irc.oftc.net). If you=20
