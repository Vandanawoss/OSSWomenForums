Hello from the Free Software Foundation!

Mark your calendars, because the LibrePlanet conference 
<https://libreplanet.org/2014> is streaming live from MIT on March 
22-23, 2014. The theme this year is Free Software, Free Society, and our 
keynote speakers include two amazing women (among many women speaking 
this year): Sue Gardner, Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation, 
and Karen Sandler, Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation.

How can free software protect journalists, whistleblowers, activists, 
and regular computer users from government and corporate surveillance? 
How can free software, or free software values like copyleft, community 
development, and transparency, be used by people fighting to create free 
societies around the world? What challenges are standing between us and 
our goal of free software ubiquity? With your help, we'll tackle these 
questions and more at LibrePlanet 2014.

We're creating our most advanced-ever free software streaming system for 
LibrePlanet 2014: If you are not able to attend in person, you can 
livestream the conference and watch recordings of the sessions 
afterwards. We encourage you to bookmark our streaming portal, 
libreplanet.org/2014/live. Participating remotely doesn't require any 
kind of registration.

At LibrePlanet, we bring together software developers, policy experts, 
activists, and computer users to learn skills, share accomplishments, 
and address challenges to software freedom. Newcomers are always 
welcome, and LibrePlanet 2014 will feature programming for all ages and 
experience levels. LibrePlanet 2014 <https://libreplanet.org/2014> is 
produced in partnership by the Free Software Foundation 
<https://www.fsf.org> with the Student Information Processing Board 
(SIPB) <http://sipb.mit.edu/> at MIT.

If you are able to attend in person, FSF members and students attend 
LibrePlanet at no cost. The conference will also feature workshops in 
using free programs, talks and discussion panels with free software 
luminaries, plentiful networking opportunities, a cryptoparty hosted at 
the FSF's offices in downtown Boston, and a cocktail party and raffle on 
Saturday night. And as always, FSF founder and president Richard 
Stallman will be on hand to present the annual Free Software Awards.

More information is available at https://libreplanet.org/2014/: Register 
for LibrePlanet today 
<https://crm.fsf.org/civicrm/event/register?reset=1&id=13>. Becoming an 
FSF member <https://www.fsf.org/associate/> will make your admission 
gratis and support the FSF's work year-round.

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions.
