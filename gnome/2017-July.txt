If we want to celebrate womens' accomplishments, then they should be
celebrated by all. If women isolate themselves, then it is more
difficult for others to learn about the work that we do.

If there is concern that there might be too many attendees and the
event would be "diluted", then it could be possible to limit the
number of open seats available, for example to the same number as
women attending the event.
