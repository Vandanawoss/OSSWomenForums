Hi all,

James Vasile, who maintains http://planeteria.org/wfs/ asked me to let women in the GNOME community know that all women who contribute to free software (and sometimes blog about it) are welcome to add their blogs to the Women in Free Software planet. Please e-mail him at james at hackervisions dot org providing RSS to your blog or feed you want to get aggregated.

We are announcing Outreach Program for Women participants for January - April 2013 tomorrow, and since they will be working with many different free software organizations, we will be aggregating their blogs on that planet, in addition to the planets specific to each participant's organization.

Thanks,
Marina

Hi all,

Jessica McKellar (a mentor for the Twisted project for the Outreach Program for Women) asked me to pass this on to you. She had the pleasure and honor of being a Resident at Hacker School this past batch and had a great time. She highly recommends it!

Please consider applying for it and feel free to pass on this information!

Thanks,
Marina

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apply to Hacker School

Hacker School is a three-month, full-time school in New York for
becoming a better programmer. It's like a writers retreat for hackers.
Tuition is free, and we provide space, a little structure, time to
focus, and a friendly community of smart people dedicated to
self-improvement.

We strive to make Hacker School the best environment to learn and grow
as a programer. Towards that end, we have explicit social rules (e.g.,
no "well, actuallys," no "feigning surprise," no "subtle sexism"), we
aim for gender parity (our past two batches were 37-45% female), and
we host amazing people as programmers in residence who work directly
with students (last batch: Jessica McKellar, Peter Seibel, Alex Payne,
Stefan Karpinski, and David Nolen).

Tuition is free, and we provide $5k, need-based grants to women for
living expenses.

We value free software, beautiful code, and personal growth. Apply now
to be part of our winter 2013 batch, which begins in February:

https://www.hackerschool.com/about
https://www.hackerschool.com/apply

You can also learn about the type of people we look for and if we'd be
a fit for you:

I got accepted for this batch too, but I didn't get the visa at the end :(.
I will try with the visa next year too and we'll see.
