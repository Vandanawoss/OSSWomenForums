Dear Sir,

 I, Sukanya Kudi, am a sixth semester undergraduate student in India. I
came to know about the Gnome Women/Outreach Program 2012 through a
friend.Since my operating system is Linux Mint , I consider it to be a
great opportunity to work for it and contribute towards it . The procedure
given on the official site has left me confused a bit. I would like to know
if i can apply for the internship now or is the deadline over .Also, please
can you send the details to be sent if I can still apply for this
internship.

Hope to see your reply soon.

Regards,
Sukanya Kudi

Hello Sukanya,

Also, the best first step is to find a mentor. This page lists the
mentors: https://live.gnome.org/GnomeLove/Mentors

You can send an email to a mentor for the projects that you want to work
on, and they will help you to find a bug and work on it. They will help
when you have questions, and they are all really nice!

Sorry I forgot to mention it before.

:)

Hi all!

We have opened the application process for the new round of internships. Th=
e dates for these internships are May 21 to August 20, 2012. These dates ma=
tch the ones for the Google Summer of Code program, so I would like to enco=
urage women who qualify for Google Summer of Code to apply for both program=
s. Google Summer of Code requires applicants to be students applying for co=
ding projects, while Outreach Program for Women internships are open to non=
-students and non-coders as well.

The application deadline is April 6, 2012. As part of the application proce=
ss, we are asking women to take the time to learn about various GNOME proje=
cts and make a small contribution to the one they are interested in. These =
projects include ones in programming, graphic design, web development, docu=
mentation, and marketing.

All the program details are here:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2012

Four creative interns from the previous rounds of the program =E2=80=93 Lia=
nsu Yu, Christy Eller, Meg Ford, and Tamara Atanasoska =E2=80=93 made an aw=
esome cartoon to better explain the program=E2=80=99s application process. =
This cartoon is featured on the program page. A big thank you for their col=
laborative work that spanned 90 e-mails over a course of a month!

Please consider applying for an internship, signing up as a mentor, or help=
ing us spread the word! Send the information about the GNOME Outreach Progr=
am for Women and Google Summer of Code to the universities, FOSS groups, an=
d technical women groups, post the flyers on the university campuses or han=
d them out at conferences, encourage anyone who'd be a good candidate to ap=
ply, or write an update about the program on Identi.ca, Twitter, Facebook o=
r Google+.

All the materials for helping us spread the word are here:

Thank you!
Marina
