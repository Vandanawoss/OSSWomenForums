Hi all,

We are opening an application process for the new round of the Outreach Program for Women, with an application deadline on November 11, and internships from December 10 to March 10. If you have an idea for a specific project you might like to mentor, please add it to https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram/2013/DecemberMarch . If you listed an idea for GSoC at https://wiki.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2013/Ideas , but didn't end up having a student who worked on it, please feel free to copy it over to the ideas page for the new OPW round.

We have all the resources for spreading the word for the new round ready at https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/DecemberMarch/SpreadTheWord Especially if you live in the Southern Hemisphere, please help spread the word by sending this information to universities.

Thanks!
Marina

Hello,

Last weekend, we had the first meeting of a small team in my city. I'll 
help them with their first meetings etc until someone will take over 
(and I won't have to organize them).

The fisrt meeting was to know each other, explain what is GNOME women 
and the reason to have such team. We had a small intro about OPW and if 
they want to join, what is the procedure.

The  post to our blog is http://gnome.gr/2013/10/07/gnome-women-no1/
And also the biggest FOSS blog reposted us (although lately they post 
more politics than FOSS):
http://osarena.net/greekcommun/h-ellinofoni-omada-gnome-women-xekinise.html

I'm in touch with everyone if they want to apply for OPW (I tell them to 
write to the opw-list for more info and guidance).
They might organize a release party for 3.10.

I was asked to have a 15-20 mins talk about GNOME next week (when I have 
more news I'll inform everyone). I plan to mention GNOME Women and OPW.

Since I don't know what you do, I would like to help me boost the team a 
little bit so they'll act themselfs.
Thanks in advance.
Have phun,
Stathis

Hello,

Since it's the first time I'm trying this, is it OK to add a marketing 
task to organize and translate the Greek GNOME.gr Wiki page?
Right now our wiki have old information how to translate. GNOME's wiki 
is huge and it's impossible to translate it 100%. But let's make a start 
and then continue from that point forward.

Please let me know, so I'll add the task to the page.
Thanks for your help
Stathis

Hello Marina,

I'm trying to spread the word about OPW.
I had couple of positive words for that but I had negative too (about 
women).
I also had personal negative comments. Trying not to reply, unless they 
want an info about the OPW.

As I said, I'll have a talk on Tuesday about GNOME at the university. 
I'll talk little bit about what is GNOME, I'll talk about community and 
I'll promote OPW.

Anyways, our team has a lady that is quite good on graphics (so if 
someone from artwork team wants to add a task for OPW would be great).
Also 3-4 of them are interested on documentation.
Finally one of them is good to organize events.

Thanks for your help.
Stathis

Hi, that strikes me as a bit of a futile task as large parts of the
wiki is outdated as it is, and many parts would not benefit from
translation (for example, the docs team pages have instructions on how
to contribute to docs, for which one must have good English skills).

>From the point of view of attracting people to the OPW, I would say
that part of the aim is to make those newcomers part of the community
and the community is (irrelevant of whether it's a good thing or a bad
thing), mostly used English to communicate.

I would prefer to see a task to get all documentation (and possibly UI
string) translations up to 100% because help.gnome.org gets lots of
views of the translated pages. On the other hand, as I have not done
translations before, I don't know if this is enough material for a
three month internship.

Hi!

A new round of Outreach Program for Women internships is taking place from =
December 10, 2013 to March 10, 2014. The application deadline is November 1=
1, 2013. The applicants need to get in touch with individual projects they =
are interested in working on and make a small contribution ahead of the app=
lication deadline. The participating organizations are:

 * Debian - GNU/Linux-based operating system
 * Fedora - GNU/Linux-based operating system
 * GNOME - GNU/Linux-based desktop environment and applications
 * Linux Kernel - the most basic layer of the GNU/Linux operating system
 * Mozilla - software that promotes the goals of the Open Web
 * OpenStack - cloud deployment and management software
 * Wikimedia - wiki software and infrastructure for Wikipedia and related p=
rojects
 * Xen Project - virtualization platform

Participants will work remotely from home, while getting guidance from an a=
ssigned mentor and collaborating within their project=E2=80=99s team and th=
e rest of the FOSS community. The projects include software development, sy=
stem administration, web development, user experience design, graphic desig=
n, documentation, and marketing. The stipend for the program is $5,000 (USD=
). Any woman available for a full time internship who has not previously pa=
rticipated in the Outreach Program for Women or Google Summer of Code is we=
lcome to apply. College women from the Southern Hemisphere who will have a =
school summer break during most of this time are particularly encouraged to=
 apply.

Please visit http://gnome.org/opw to learn more and apply. This program is =
organized by the GNOME Foundation. Please help us spread the word by forwar=
ding this message to interested university and community groups.

The mentorship opportunities are also available throughout the year for any=
one interested in getting started contributing to FOSS outside of the inter=
nship program.

Thanks,
Marina

Hello my friends,

Dunno if this is the correct place to mail this.
I had a talk at the University of Macedonia (Thessaloniki-Greece) about 
how to use GNOME (some basics) and how to contribute to our community. I 
also mentioned about Outreach Program for Women and until now I had 2 
women that wrote me mail asking for more info.

I wrote a short report
http://blogs.gnome.org/eiosifidis/2013/10/26/linux-team-pamak-no1/

You can see some pictures there.

Also there a video (in Greek) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2-IPtviD4

Have phun,
Stathis

Great leaders don't tell you what to do...They show you how it's done.
Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts...absolutely.
The difference between fiction and reality is fiction has to make sense.

Hello,

After my presentation at the university, I had 2 women interested (I 
added their mails here. I asked them to register to mailing list).

Well, do you think that we better translate everything we see at:
https://l10n.gnome.org/teams/el/

Not sure where help.gnome.org is translated but I hope at the above link.
SInce it's my first time, I'm not sure about the amount of the pages 
that must be translated. Can someone help me?
Also I don't know how to apply. But first thing first. Let's find the 
idea, then the mentor and then application.

Thanks for your help.
Stathis

Pages from help.gnome.org appear at
https://l10n.gnome.org/languages/el/gnome-3-12/doc/ and go on the
website after every release.

Friedel Wolff and Ihar Hrachyshka have mentored women for the OPW
before, so you may want to talk to them.

Hello,

I sent mails to Friedel and Ihar and got replies.
Well, our language is close to 100% translated. I'm thinking to have 
3.12 translated and reviewed (GUI and DOCS). Then start translating 
everything else, except the older versions (3.08 and 3.10).
I'll try to write the proposal at the website. If someone wants to 
correct what I'll write, please do it.
Until now I have 3 women that want to apply for translation and one 
wants to apply for artwork (I don't know how to help her on that). So if 
you can point me someone (name-mail)  that she can contact directly, it 
would be nice.

Thanks for your help.
Have phun,
Stathis

You can find the list of mentors at
https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeLove/Mentors#Design.2C_Documentation.2C_Engagem=
ent.2C_etc.

Come to think of it, you should probably add yourself there as well :)
