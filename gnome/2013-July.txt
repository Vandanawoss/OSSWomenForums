Hi all,

I am an undergraduate student at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information
and Communication Technology. I have known the FOSS culture and Open source
organizations since past 8 months and love it.

I belong to a university, where there are brilliant coders and students
with great potentials, but there are few who have got in-depth knowledge
about open source, how anyone can become a part of it and there exists many
misconceptions about it. I have read up how Gnome supports
new contributes and coders and encourages them and I really like it.

This is often considered as a male-dominated field, where hardly women are
aware of it. To increase the awareness among women in software development,
hats off to programs like Outreach Program for Women. I was unfortunate to
hear about it after the deadline elasped and couldn't participate in it but
fortunate enough to know its hand in hand another program- Google Summer of
Code and be a part of it.

Amongst the 17 students selected from our university this year, I am the
only girl student. None of my female batchmates or female seniors present
at college have got the same opportunity as me. Many of my batchmates,
juniors and friends ask me how do I start. I do explain them to the best I
can, but still I feel something is lacked and I can't guide them 100%.

I use Gnome and its various softwares. One of them, I feel more attached
with is GCompris. My younger sister loves it and plays it all day long. I
have many plans in head for its improvement. I have downloaded its source
but had got no time to hack upon it due to current project. I plan working
for it after september and do a full time project for its improvement and
adding new activities.

I am willing to attend GUADEC 2013 to learn more about Gnome, involve my
fellow batchmates, junior and friends and also for myself to contribute to
it. I want to meet this awesome community and wonderful people from it, but
I am in financial crisis. It would be great if I can get some sponsership
so that I can attend this conference and bridge the gap.

I am interested in many talks which includes First Step Towards
Contributing, Gnome in Open Source Community, Gnome Outreach from Three
Point zero to Hero,FLOSS community outreaches, Outreach Preogram for
Women-Lessons in Collaboration, Foss & Education. I am also willing to
volunteer, if given an opportunity to come which may smooth the management
and I can get to help this awesome community :)

I know it has been too long, but thanks for spending you time and reading
it :)

Best Regards,
-- 
Kesha Shah.

Hi Roopesh,

-Regarding the size of sponsorship, I would be great if I can get travel
support.
-I believe in-person meeting, having interactions and attending will have a
huge impact over webinars.
-Sure. This was one of the things in my mind like adding support to Hindi
and small Hindi alphabet recognization and playing activity.
Also, in the joining different province to make a country activity which
exist now (oops ! I cant recall the name), I also thought of adding Indian
states- this will make small Indian kids recognize different states, where
it is located, how many are there etc.
With a little more effort, if we can include capital of every state that
would also be great !
An actiivity regarding recipes of Indian dishes will also be cool :)
These are few which involves adding activities specific to Indian audience.

Best Regards,

Hi all,

I am an undergraduate student at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information
and Communication Technology. I have known the FOSS culture and Open source
organizations since past 8 months and love it.

I belong to a university, where there are brilliant coders and students
with great potentials, but there are few who have got in-depth knowledge
about open source, how anyone can become a part of it and there exists many
misconceptions about it. I have read up how Gnome supports
new contributes and coders and encourages them and I really like it.

This is often considered as a male-dominated field, where hardly women are
aware of it. To increase the awareness among women in software development,
hats off to programs like Outreach Program for Women. I was unfortunate to
hear about it after the deadline elasped and couldn't participate in it but
fortunate enough to know its hand in hand another program- Google Summer of
Code and be a part of it.

Amongst the 17 students selected from our university this year, I am the
only girl student. None of my female batchmates or female seniors present
at college have got the same opportunity as me. Many of my batchmates,
juniors and friends ask me how do I start. I do explain them to the best I
can, but still I feel something is lacked and I can't guide them 100%.

I use Gnome and its various softwares. One of them, I feel more attached
with is GCompris. My younger sister loves it and plays it all day long. I
have many plans in head for its improvement. I have downloaded its source
but had got no time to hack upon it due to current project. I plan working
for it after september and do a full time project for its improvement and
adding new activities.

I am willing to attend GUADEC 2013 to learn more about Gnome, involve my
fellow batchmates, junior and friends and also for myself to contribute to
it. I want to meet this awesome community and wonderful people from it, but
I am in financial crisis. It would be great if I can get some sponsership
so that I can attend this conference and bridge the gap.

I am interested in many talks which includes First Step Towards
Contributing, Gnome in Open Source Community, Gnome Outreach from Three
Point zero to Hero,FLOSS community outreaches, Outreach Preogram for
Women-Lessons in Collaboration, Foss & Education. I am also willing to
volunteer, if given an opportunity to come which may smooth the management
and I can get to help this awesome community :)

I know it has been too long, but thanks for spending you time and reading
it :)

Best Regards,
--

Hi Roopesh,

Thank you for your views. Academically, I am bright, but I have realized
that just learning things isolated and small lab codes do not help much.
One should have some experience how large real world codebase are
maintained and worked with with many developers contributing at the same
time.

Moreover, my intention is not exactly to learn FOSS and get involved in
open source projects. I already have the basics idea and I am currently a
GSoC student. My main aim for attending this conference is knowing more
about GNOME and get myself involved in Gcompris and introduce my fellow
batchmates and juniors to this fascinating community. We have got a lot of
spirit and enthusiastic students at DA-IICT, but still most of them are not
aware, how to enhance their skills in a better direction. I found this
Gnome community as the best because it provides a lot of options and every
interested student can contribute to the field which he/she likes. Also, I
love gnome for its encouragement of Female developers. I am the only girl
from my university and I know how my friends are ignorant about it and the
difficulties I faced. I also want to learn how large international
conferences are organized and I am interested in getting more experience in
management, so I wish to volunteer there also. In the month of September,
we usually have a seminar in our college to introduce juniors to open
source, gsoc and similar opportunities. I wish to take a session there
about GNOME in particular, if I have enough knowledge about it.

I agree that visas needs to be arranged, and still we have 13 days, its not
too late also. If things get to sort out fast and if I get confirmation for
some financial help as soon as possible , probably by tomorrow, I can start
visa procedure. I have very short time, but if tried, I am sure we can deal
with it and successfully do it in time. Can you please discuss with company
.Waiting for fellow Gnome community members to have their opinion and
response.

Thank you and do reply soon :)

Cheers !

Best Regards,

<div dir=3D"ltr">Hi Roopesh,<div><br></div><div style>Thank you for your vi=
ews. Academically, I am bright, but I have realized that just learning thin=
gs isolated and small lab codes do not help much. One should have some expe=
rience how large real world codebase are maintained and worked with with ma=
ny developers contributing at the same time.</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>Moreover, my intention is not exactly to le=
arn FOSS and get involved in open source projects. I already have the basic=
s idea and I am currently a GSoC student. My main aim for attending this co=
nference is knowing more about GNOME and get myself involved in Gcompris an=
d introduce my fellow batchmates and juniors to this fascinating community.=
 We have got a lot of spirit and=A0enthusiastic=A0students at DA-IICT, but =
still most of them are not aware, how to enhance their skills in a better d=
irection. I found this Gnome community as the best because it provides a lo=
t of options and every interested student can contribute to the field which=
 he/she likes. Also, I love gnome for its encouragement of Female developer=
s. I am the only girl from my university and I know how my friends are igno=
rant about it and the difficulties I faced. I also want to learn how large =
international conferences are organized and I am interested in getting more=
 experience in management, so I wish to volunteer there also. In the month =
of September, we usually have a seminar in our college to introduce juniors=
 to open source, gsoc and similar opportunities. I wish to take a session t=
here about GNOME in particular, if I have enough knowledge about it.</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>I agree that visas needs to be arranged, an=

I am an undergraduate student at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information<=

hats off to programs like Outreach Program for Women. I was unfortunate to<=

fortunate enough to know its hand in hand another program- Google Summer of=

<br>
Amongst the 17 students selected from our university this year, I am the<br=

Hi,
I usually dont top-post but that seems to be the trend in this thread
so sorry about the bungled order.

Kesha, Glad to see another Indian woman in Foss. Welcome!

Could you please not post Roopesh's mail on the list, especially since
he has explicitly said his mail (to you) is off-list, for the second
time. Since you are new, I wanted to let you know that posting
people's private mails to a publicly archived mailing list, without
their permission**, is considered rude. Its is an unwritten rule
(more, an etiquette) that people are expected to abide by.

... and while at it, since you asked here is my zero paise worth:  I
completely agree with Roopesh's opinions. He has explained it well
imho. If your goal is to introduce fellow-students to Foss, you can do
it from within India - find a Gnome project that they are interested
in, organize a bug/hack-fest, join their irc channel (if you want live
help from core-devs) and get started. Most Foss dev's wont be mad at
getting free help :). As for knowing about Gnome, there is a lot of
information online which you can use for your presentations.

Once you have done the above, you'd have also learned to organize,
speak, co-ordinate and manage a group of people, thereby obtaining the
management experience you seek. Hope that helps!

best,
Vid

Hi Kesha,

thanks for your interest! However, the deadline for GUADEC travel
sponsorship application was in May, see
https://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2013-May/msg00166.html
and from personal experience it's unlikely that you could arrange a visa
within two weeks...  But in case things don't work out this year it
would be awesome to see you at next year's GUADEC conference in
Strasbourg (France)!

Cheers,
andre
