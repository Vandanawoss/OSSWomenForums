Hi everyone,

The GNOME Foundation has just announced that it will be running a
"Summer of Code"-like program for female students in order to promote
the participation of women in GNOME-related development!

If you're interested and eligible, visit the program website
(www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/) and fill out the application form! If
you don't want to apply (or aren't eligible) but would like to help
out, the best way to do this is to tell others about the program
and/or put up a poster (www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/poster.pdf),
designed by our own Mairin Duffy.

For more information, see the press release
(www.gnome.org/press/releases/wsop.html) and the program website
(www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/).

This is great! :)

I've sent it to my son, and asked him to make sure all the female =20
students in his faculty  know about it. He considers the proportion =20
of female students shockingly low, but it's a start...

My pleasure. I've also introduced it at VNOSS (Vietnamese Open-source =20=

Software community), explaining it and stressing the opportunity. In =20
that mail, I also offered to help them cross any communication or =20
confidence barriers which they may find intimidating. Participation =20
by Vietnamese women online is much worse even than the average: I =20
have not yet met a single other Vietnamese woman who actually =20
participates online. :(

I do know, though, that one or two lurk on the VNOSS list, and others =20=

have male family members there.

So I do hope for something from this. :)

Hi everyone,

The GNOME Foundation has just announced that it will be running a
"Summer of Code"-like program for female students in order to promote
the participation of women in GNOME-related development!

If you're interested and eligible, visit the program website
(www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/) and fill out the application form! If
you don't want to apply (or aren't eligible) but would like to help
out, the best way to do this is to tell others about the program
and/or put up a poster (www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/poster.pdf),
designed by our own Mairin Duffy.

For more information, see the press release
(www.gnome.org/press/releases/wsop.html) and the program website
(www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/).

This is great! :)

I've sent it to my son, and asked him to make sure all the female =20
students in his faculty  know about it. He considers the proportion =20
of female students shockingly low, but it's a start...

My pleasure. I've also introduced it at VNOSS (Vietnamese Open-source =20=

Software community), explaining it and stressing the opportunity. In =20
that mail, I also offered to help them cross any communication or =20
confidence barriers which they may find intimidating. Participation =20
by Vietnamese women online is much worse even than the average: I =20
have not yet met a single other Vietnamese woman who actually =20
participates online. :(

I do know, though, that one or two lurk on the VNOSS list, and others =20=

have male family members there.

So I do hope for something from this. :)

Hi everyone,

The GNOME Foundation has just announced that it will be running a
"Summer of Code"-like program for female students in order to promote
the participation of women in GNOME-related development!

If you're interested and eligible, visit the program website
(www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/) and fill out the application form! If
you don't want to apply (or aren't eligible) but would like to help
out, the best way to do this is to tell others about the program
and/or put up a poster (www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/poster.pdf),
designed by our own Mairin Duffy.

For more information, see the press release
(www.gnome.org/press/releases/wsop.html) and the program website
(www.gnome.org/projects/wsop/).

This is great! :)

I've sent it to my son, and asked him to make sure all the female =20
students in his faculty  know about it. He considers the proportion =20
of female students shockingly low, but it's a start...
