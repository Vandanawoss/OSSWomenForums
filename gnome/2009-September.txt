My turn for intros ...

My name is Stormy Peters and I currently work as the Executive Director of
the GNOME Foundation. I do a bit of everything from marketing to press to
fundraising to general housekeeping and recruiting. I originally met the
GNOME community back in 1999 or 2000 when I was managing the CDE team at HP=
.
They convinced me that the open source community are great people and that
the open source model is a very effective one. (I was greeted at my first
GUADEC in Copenhagen with "YOU'RE A GIRL!".)

I'm very interested in meeting women in open source and making sure we all
have what we need to make powerful contributions and to recruit more women.
I think by not attracting women to our projects we are missing out a lot of
really good contributors. I think one of the best ways to recruit women is
to make sure the women we do have are visible.

Hello,

My name is Anne Sorsa and I work as a IT-Specialist in end-user support. I
also study in Degree Programme in Information Technology at North Karelia
University of Applied Sciences.

In my "previous life" I worked in office. My tasks were correspondence,
interpretation and PC support. My "working" languages were English, Swedish,
German, French and Estonian, but I have done translations mainly
Finnish-English-Finnish or Finnish-Swedish-Finnish.

My passions are computers, Linux and open source. Also I like to learn new
things about computing. I have used Linux since 2000. I have tried various
distros from Slackware to Fedora Core. At the moment I use Ubuntu 9.04. I
Also translate Ubuntu as a hobby.

I am member of:
* LinuxChix
* i18-mentor
* Ubuntu-Women
* Debian-Women
* Ubuntu Finnish Translators

Hi!<br>
<br>
The broader free software community has restarted the discussion about wome=

1], plans to host a women in free software mini-summit [2], and approaching=
 the GNOME project about running another women outreach program [3].<br>

<br>
Running another women outreach program is a very concrete way of getting mo=
re women contributors, and I&#39;d like to ask you to review the current id=
eas for the program on the wiki and share any feedback you have.<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram" target=3D"_bla=

This also sounds like a great time for re-vitalizing the Women in GNOME com=
munity. So I would like to propose we do a round of introductions. The firs=
t bullet point on the GnomeWomen wiki page is &quot;providing role models b=
y increasing the visibility of active women in GNOME&quot; and I think it i=

 women-friendly environment and serve as a starting point of contact for wo=
men who want to get involved.<br>

<br>
Finally, please join the Women in GNOME group I created on Facebook:<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=3D118943919669" target=3D"=

<br>
As for my introduction, I work as a software developer on the GNOME Shell p=
roject [4] at Red Hat. Working on the GNOME Shell is particularly exciting =
because it is the next generation of the GNOME desktop or GNOME 3. I get to=
 code many parts of the desktop interface, weigh in on the design decisions=
, and make sure that our project is friendly to new contributors by updatin=
g the wiki and offering answers to anything I know about on IRC. Because GN=
OME Shell is a community project, I get to work with people from Red Hat an=
d with anyone from the GNOME community who decides to contribute. Everyone =
is top-notch and motivated, and while people have strong opinions, they are=
 generally polite. I have recently started blogging [5], and hope to keep m=
y blog updated with the GNOME Shell news and posts that will encourage wome=
n to get involved in GNOME.<br>

<br>
Now it&#39;s your turn :)!<br>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I'm meeting with the National Center for Women & Information Technology[1]
either tomorrow or next week. They are interested in what types of studies
about women and open source would be useful to open source software
projects.

I think to be successful at making a change they would have to include the
project in the process and have a very actionable list of recommended
things.

Thoughts? Ideas?

Thanks,

Stormy

Hello girls :)

My name is Izabel Valverde, I´m from
Brazil and member of Gnome foundation since 2004 and envolced with open
source since 1999.
I´m working as O&M Manager on a
educational group in Curitiba, Paraná. My professional life started
as help-desk (when I´ve learned a lot!) after programming,
managing,... but my favorite function was Test System analyst.

For Gnome envolved most of time in local marketing. I did organize some
foruns, meetings and tried to garantee Gnome on the most important
Congress in Brazil. I´m also supposed to work on membership
applications but it´s a long story for another time.

Looking back I feel pretty happy cause in 2003, 2004 Gnome around here
wasn´t a big deal... we even appear... and now we are a great
community. Last year we received a prize. And what makes me happier is the
winner was voted for people who was participating on the congress -
Latinoware (it´s on my state! :-)

I hope not be losted on
my point :(
and
please forgive always my bad english :((

I´m here ready to help, discuss and improve!

Best

Izabel

Hello all,

My name is Ara and I work for Canonical as part of the Ubuntu QA team. I 
would love to know more about women in GNOME and to be able to share 
experiences.

I am doing desktop testing automation for GNOME (I started the GNOME 
desktop testing effort [1]). I use Mago [2], a tool and process based in 
LDTP. I could write an article about GNOME desktop testing automation 
and how to use Mago for it.

How does that sound?

Cheers,
Ara.

That'd be great! I also think it will be really good to spread the word
about the GNOME desktop testing automation.

I added it to http://live.gnome.org/GnomeJournal/ArticleSubmissionQueue. You
can find writing guidelines here, http://live.gnome.org/GnomeJournal.

James Vasile, from the Software Freedom Law Center, has created
Planetaria.org with a Planet for FOSS Women!
http://planeteria.org/wfs/

He's hoping it will help encourage more women to participate in free
software. He modeled it after Planet GNOME which is an easy and fun
way to keep up with the GNOME community.

He could use some help now recruiting women in free software with
blogs to be added to the planet, so please spread the word and
encourage people to participate.

Also if someone is willing to help do some of the admin work, he would
welcome the help and can add you to the administrative interface.

Are you a women that works in free software? Do you have a blog? Send it in!

Best,

Stormy

That really cool! *Adds that to her bookmarks*

FYI. I'm pretty sure Stephane Delcroix identifies as male
( http://www.blogger.com/profile/13725417672949898970 )

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane is a male name, not to be

Greetings,

Wow, it's great to see life here!

I'm Melissa Draper from Australia. I'm secretary of my LUG[0], on the
Linux Australia[1] Council, and on the Ubuntu Asia-Oceania Regional
Membership Board, as well as the Ubuntu IRC Council.

I'm a php developer/web designer by trade, but currently I've been
seconded to a company my boss purchased recently which is actually a
retail store for Linux. It's been out of action for a bit, but I get to
revive it, which is exciting.

Greetings again,

I've been lurking in the #gnome-women IRC channel on Gimpnet for quite a
while now, and it has always been really quiet. However lately, I'm
usually the only one there! :(

It would certainly be great to have some company there. *hint* *hint*

Hi Izabel!  Good to hear from you!

The admin work is super simple.  If you click on "Admin interface" on
the right side of the <http://planeteria.org/wfs> page, you can edit
the feed to add/subtract users.  The password is "wfs".  Shhh! ;)

The admin work is essentially adding new people to the feed, changing
URLs if needed, adding faces where available, removing dead blogs and
removing people that want to leave.  They update you by email, you
make the necessary changes to the feed.

First up is Ubuntu Women at <http://planet.ubuntu-women.org/>.  They
didn't want to be included as a group, so we need to email each of the
people in the UW feed who aren't already on the WFS feed and ask if
they want to be included.  If they do, we need their name, the URL of
their blog feed and (if they want) a url of a picture (no greater than
250x250 pixels) to associate with their feed.  Enter it in the form
and... you're good.

The software is rather beta, so let me know if you have any problems
with it.  Once you're comfortable I'll start directing people to you
instead of me for further stuff!

Peace!

Hrm, looks like I hit reply-all.  I guess I should change that
password now.  Sorry, all.
