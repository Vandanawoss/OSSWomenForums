Hi everyone :)

I've posted this to more than one place, so sorry if you got it more =20
than once. I think this is an opportunity to make some change that =20
will forward our aims, so I'm trying to publicize it. I hope that's OK.

The Debian Project Leader elections are on. I'd completely missed =20
this, being unable to keep up with debian-devel, and my husband, who =20
is a keen Debian user, says he had missed it, too. That makes me =20
wonder just how many people _do_ know about it.

Debian is a very important project in Open Source, and one where we =20
have identified some specific issues affecting the participation of =20
women and new people in general.

I've started to read the platforms, don't know if I can get through =20
them all, but I'm definitely impressed by this statement from Jeroen =20
van Wolffelaar [1]
>
> I will push for the adoption of a code of conduct. I do feel =20

I believe this is important, and should be applied also to IRC =20
channels, fora and any other Debian method of communication.

It's worth me reading the platforms, or as much as I can, then =20
voting. I hope you think it's worth your time, too. Here is our =20
chance to change things, not just feel unhappy about them.

Voting is not difficult, but you need to have a PGP key logged with =20
Debian (to identify you, and prevent multiple voting or other =20
deceitful acts). The election mail says:

> NOTE: The vote must be GPG signed
> (or PGP signed) with your key that is in the Debian keyring.

Now, how do we know if our key is in the Debian keyring or not? I've =20
asked on my usual Debian mailing list, debian-i18n, and hope to know =20
the answer soon. I'll post it when I have it, or iof someone here =20
knows the answer, please post it.

The mail to debian-devel said that voting had been very low. This =20
means each vote counts more. We can make a difference here. :)

To vote, first read the platform information [2]. Then:

1. Copy the box below into an email:

> - - -=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- Don't Delete Anything Between These Lines =
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=20
> =3D-=3D-=3D-
> 52717dc0-26e3-4337-a88b-cc2c260fcb51
> [   ] Choice 1: Jeroen van Wolffelaar
> [   ] Choice 2: Ari Pollak
> [   ] Choice 3: Steve McIntyre
> [   ] Choice 4: Anthony Towns
> [   ] Choice 5: Andreas Schuldei
> [   ] Choice 6: Jonathan aka Ted Walther
> [   ] Choice 7: Bill Allombert
> [   ] Choice 8: None Of The Above
> - - -=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- Don't Delete Anything Between These Lines =
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=20
> =3D-=3D-=3D-

2. Then mark from 1 to 8 in the [ ] on the left-hand side.

If you definitely want someone _not_ included, mark them lower than =20
None of the Above, e.g. if there is one person you really don't want =20
to vote _for_, mark None of the Above as 7, and him [3] as 8. If you =20
want everyone to have a good chance, mark None of the Above as 8. =20
Anyone below None of the Above will only be counted after all the =20
other votes.

3. Attach your PGP key to the mail (your usual "sign with PGP" =20
action, e.g. my mailer just has a box I check that says "PGP signed. =20
You may have this set to happen automatically: check your preferences.)

4. Send the mail to <leader2006@vote.debian.org>.

You should receive a receipt mail which has the Debian vote PGP key =20
attached. The original mail about this election will be on debian-=20
devel, and there should be lots of info about the election at =20
<debian.org>.

If you don't receive a receipt email, maybe something went wrong, and =20=

it would be worth asking someone to check if it went through. I don't =20=

know whom we would ask, as yet. ;)

Let's make a difference today. Vote in the Debian Project Leader =20
elections [4].

Just FYI: In order to vote, you have to be a Debian Developer, which is
how you know if your key is in the keyring or not. If you haven't gone
through the Debian new maintainer process and been accepted, you are
unable to vote.

I'm sorry, I didn't know this. It certainly didn't say that in the =20

This certainly restricts the voting to a small pool. What about all =20

This has been raised as a concern by other people before, see for
example Benjamin Mako Hill at http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/2005/Jul/19 .
That argument is, I believe, much of the reason that applying for Ubuntu
*membership* and Ubuntu *maintainership* (for example) are separate
processes. See also criteria for voting in GNOME Foundation elections at
http://foundation.gnome.org/membership/ . (Typically, there is usually
*some* level of involvement required before being given voting rights,
or it's too easy to rig elections or 'steal' a project's resources.)

The most effective protest would probably be working within Debian to
amend the rules to either allow (some) non-developers to vote, or to
change the criteria for a developer. I suspect from Mako's blog entry
that there are some ideas other people have that would be useful. On the
other hand, there's only so much time in the day... ;)

This is the last item in the Gnome Foundation minutes for March 1st =20
2006. It only came into my mailbox today.

I don't understand the Gnome decision-making structure well : can we, =20=

as Gnome-Women, make recommendations to the Foundation, or present =20
information?

In other words, how can we act as a focus group to do raise female =20

Is anyone here going to be at GUADEC? Is there anyone here, or do we =20
know any other woman who would be willing to deliver a talk/workshop =20
on female participation (Getting the O+ into Gnome ;) ) ?

I'd be happy to help with preparing the paper/workshop. I have a good =20=

deal of experience with preparing and delivering them.

Unfortunately, since I am bedridden and unable to travel, I can only =20
participate by computer. We have a Gnome Women's group: is there any =20
focus person or group for accessibility issues? I'd like to highlight =20=

the participation needs of disabled/isolated people, and encourage =20
more presentations/activities to include people communicating from a =20
distance, or at least to provide recorded info that can be downloaded.

I am going to be at GUADEC and I think Hanna was thinking about it but had a 
scheduling issue. I'd be happy to present a paper and/or recording, and if you'd 
like to work with me on preparing a paper that'd be awesome Clytie! :)

Hi everyone :)

I've posted this to more than one place, so sorry if you got it more =20
than once. I think this is an opportunity to make some change that =20
will forward our aims, so I'm trying to publicize it. I hope that's OK.

The Debian Project Leader elections are on. I'd completely missed =20
this, being unable to keep up with debian-devel, and my husband, who =20
is a keen Debian user, says he had missed it, too. That makes me =20
wonder just how many people _do_ know about it.

Debian is a very important project in Open Source, and one where we =20
have identified some specific issues affecting the participation of =20
women and new people in general.

I've started to read the platforms, don't know if I can get through =20
them all, but I'm definitely impressed by this statement from Jeroen =20
van Wolffelaar [1]
>
> I will push for the adoption of a code of conduct. I do feel =20

> moderation.

I believe this is important, and should be applied also to IRC =20
channels, fora and any other Debian method of communication.

It's worth me reading the platforms, or as much as I can, then =20
voting. I hope you think it's worth your time, too. Here is our =20
chance to change things, not just feel unhappy about them.

Voting is not difficult, but you need to have a PGP key logged with =20
Debian (to identify you, and prevent multiple voting or other =20
deceitful acts). The election mail says:

> NOTE: The vote must be GPG signed
> (or PGP signed) with your key that is in the Debian keyring.

Now, how do we know if our key is in the Debian keyring or not? I've =20
asked on my usual Debian mailing list, debian-i18n, and hope to know =20
the answer soon. I'll post it when I have it, or iof someone here =20
knows the answer, please post it.

The mail to debian-devel said that voting had been very low. This =20
means each vote counts more. We can make a difference here. :)

To vote, first read the platform information [2]. Then:

1. Copy the box below into an email:

> - - -=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- Don't Delete Anything Between These Lines =
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=20
> =3D-=3D-=3D-
> 52717dc0-26e3-4337-a88b-cc2c260fcb51
> [   ] Choice 1: Jeroen van Wolffelaar
> [   ] Choice 2: Ari Pollak
> [   ] Choice 3: Steve McIntyre
> [   ] Choice 4: Anthony Towns
> [   ] Choice 5: Andreas Schuldei
> [   ] Choice 6: Jonathan aka Ted Walther
> [   ] Choice 7: Bill Allombert
> [   ] Choice 8: None Of The Above
> - - -=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- Don't Delete Anything Between These Lines =
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=20
> =3D-=3D-=3D-

2. Then mark from 1 to 8 in the [ ] on the left-hand side.

If you definitely want someone _not_ included, mark them lower than =20
None of the Above, e.g. if there is one person you really don't want =20
to vote _for_, mark None of the Above as 7, and him [3] as 8. If you =20
want everyone to have a good chance, mark None of the Above as 8. =20
Anyone below None of the Above will only be counted after all the =20
other votes.

3. Attach your PGP key to the mail (your usual "sign with PGP" =20
action, e.g. my mailer just has a box I check that says "PGP signed. =20
You may have this set to happen automatically: check your preferences.)

4. Send the mail to <leader2006@vote.debian.org>.

You should receive a receipt mail which has the Debian vote PGP key =20
attached. The original mail about this election will be on debian-=20
devel, and there should be lots of info about the election at =20
<debian.org>.

If you don't receive a receipt email, maybe something went wrong, and =20=

it would be worth asking someone to check if it went through. I don't =20=

know whom we would ask, as yet. ;)

Let's make a difference today. Vote in the Debian Project Leader =20
elections [4].

Just FYI: In order to vote, you have to be a Debian Developer, which is
how you know if your key is in the keyring or not. If you haven't gone
through the Debian new maintainer process and been accepted, you are
unable to vote.

I'm sorry, I didn't know this. It certainly didn't say that in the =20
election mail.

This certainly restricts the voting to a small pool. What about all =20
the other people who contribute their time and effort to the project?

I feel a protest coming on... ;)

This has been raised as a concern by other people before, see for
example Benjamin Mako Hill at http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/2005/Jul/19 .
That argument is, I believe, much of the reason that applying for Ubuntu
*membership* and Ubuntu *maintainership* (for example) are separate
processes. See also criteria for voting in GNOME Foundation elections at
http://foundation.gnome.org/membership/ . (Typically, there is usually
*some* level of involvement required before being given voting rights,
or it's too easy to rig elections or 'steal' a project's resources.)

The most effective protest would probably be working within Debian to
amend the rules to either allow (some) non-developers to vote, or to
change the criteria for a developer. I suspect from Mako's blog entry
that there are some ideas other people have that would be useful. On the
other hand, there's only so much time in the day... ;)

This is the last item in the Gnome Foundation minutes for March 1st =20
2006. It only came into my mailbox today.

I don't understand the Gnome decision-making structure well : can we, =20=

as Gnome-Women, make recommendations to the Foundation, or present =20
information?

In other words, how can we act as a focus group to do raise female =20
participation in Gnome, and keep the Foundation involved/informed?

Is anyone here going to be at GUADEC? Is there anyone here, or do we =20
know any other woman who would be willing to deliver a talk/workshop =20
on female participation (Getting the O+ into Gnome ;) ) ?

I'd be happy to help with preparing the paper/workshop. I have a good =20=

deal of experience with preparing and delivering them.

Unfortunately, since I am bedridden and unable to travel, I can only =20
participate by computer. We have a Gnome Women's group: is there any =20
focus person or group for accessibility issues? I'd like to highlight =20=

the participation needs of disabled/isolated people, and encourage =20
more presentations/activities to include people communicating from a =20
distance, or at least to provide recorded info that can be downloaded.

I am going to be at GUADEC and I think Hanna was thinking about it but had a 
scheduling issue. I'd be happy to present a paper and/or recording, and if you'd 
like to work with me on preparing a paper that'd be awesome Clytie! :)

Hi everyone :)

I've posted this to more than one place, so sorry if you got it more =20
than once. I think this is an opportunity to make some change that =20
will forward our aims, so I'm trying to publicize it. I hope that's OK.

The Debian Project Leader elections are on. I'd completely missed =20
this, being unable to keep up with debian-devel, and my husband, who =20
is a keen Debian user, says he had missed it, too. That makes me =20
wonder just how many people _do_ know about it.

Debian is a very important project in Open Source, and one where we =20
have identified some specific issues affecting the participation of =20
women and new people in general.

I've started to read the platforms, don't know if I can get through =20
them all, but I'm definitely impressed by this statement from Jeroen =20
van Wolffelaar [1]
>
> I will push for the adoption of a code of conduct. I do feel =20

I believe this is important, and should be applied also to IRC =20
channels, fora and any other Debian method of communication.

It's worth me reading the platforms, or as much as I can, then =20
voting. I hope you think it's worth your time, too. Here is our =20
chance to change things, not just feel unhappy about them.

Voting is not difficult, but you need to have a PGP key logged with =20
Debian (to identify you, and prevent multiple voting or other =20
deceitful acts). The election mail says:

> NOTE: The vote must be GPG signed
> (or PGP signed) with your key that is in the Debian keyring.

Now, how do we know if our key is in the Debian keyring or not? I've =20
asked on my usual Debian mailing list, debian-i18n, and hope to know =20
the answer soon. I'll post it when I have it, or iof someone here =20
knows the answer, please post it.

The mail to debian-devel said that voting had been very low. This =20
means each vote counts more. We can make a difference here. :)

To vote, first read the platform information [2]. Then:

1. Copy the box below into an email:

> - - -=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- Don't Delete Anything Between These Lines =
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=20
> =3D-=3D-=3D-
> 52717dc0-26e3-4337-a88b-cc2c260fcb51
> [   ] Choice 1: Jeroen van Wolffelaar
> [   ] Choice 2: Ari Pollak
> [   ] Choice 3: Steve McIntyre
> [   ] Choice 4: Anthony Towns
> [   ] Choice 5: Andreas Schuldei
> [   ] Choice 6: Jonathan aka Ted Walther
> [   ] Choice 7: Bill Allombert
> [   ] Choice 8: None Of The Above
> - - -=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D- Don't Delete Anything Between These Lines =
=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=3D-=20
> =3D-=3D-=3D-

2. Then mark from 1 to 8 in the [ ] on the left-hand side.

If you definitely want someone _not_ included, mark them lower than =20
None of the Above, e.g. if there is one person you really don't want =20
to vote _for_, mark None of the Above as 7, and him [3] as 8. If you =20
want everyone to have a good chance, mark None of the Above as 8. =20
Anyone below None of the Above will only be counted after all the =20
other votes.

3. Attach your PGP key to the mail (your usual "sign with PGP" =20
action, e.g. my mailer just has a box I check that says "PGP signed. =20
You may have this set to happen automatically: check your preferences.)

4. Send the mail to <leader2006@vote.debian.org>.

You should receive a receipt mail which has the Debian vote PGP key =20
attached. The original mail about this election will be on debian-=20
devel, and there should be lots of info about the election at =20
<debian.org>.

If you don't receive a receipt email, maybe something went wrong, and =20=

it would be worth asking someone to check if it went through. I don't =20=

know whom we would ask, as yet. ;)

Let's make a difference today. Vote in the Debian Project Leader =20
elections [4].

Just FYI: In order to vote, you have to be a Debian Developer, which is
how you know if your key is in the keyring or not. If you haven't gone
through the Debian new maintainer process and been accepted, you are
unable to vote.

I'm sorry, I didn't know this. It certainly didn't say that in the =20

This certainly restricts the voting to a small pool. What about all =20

This has been raised as a concern by other people before, see for
example Benjamin Mako Hill at http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/2005/Jul/19 .
That argument is, I believe, much of the reason that applying for Ubuntu
*membership* and Ubuntu *maintainership* (for example) are separate
processes. See also criteria for voting in GNOME Foundation elections at
http://foundation.gnome.org/membership/ . (Typically, there is usually
*some* level of involvement required before being given voting rights,
or it's too easy to rig elections or 'steal' a project's resources.)

The most effective protest would probably be working within Debian to
amend the rules to either allow (some) non-developers to vote, or to
change the criteria for a developer. I suspect from Mako's blog entry
that there are some ideas other people have that would be useful. On the
other hand, there's only so much time in the day... ;)

This is the last item in the Gnome Foundation minutes for March 1st =20
2006. It only came into my mailbox today.

I don't understand the Gnome decision-making structure well : can we, =20=

as Gnome-Women, make recommendations to the Foundation, or present =20
information?

In other words, how can we act as a focus group to do raise female =20
participation in Gnome, and keep the Foundation involved/informed?

Is anyone here going to be at GUADEC? Is there anyone here, or do we =20
know any other woman who would be willing to deliver a talk/workshop =20
on female participation (Getting the O+ into Gnome ;) ) ?

I'd be happy to help with preparing the paper/workshop. I have a good =20=

deal of experience with preparing and delivering them.

Unfortunately, since I am bedridden and unable to travel, I can only =20
participate by computer. We have a Gnome Women's group: is there any =20
focus person or group for accessibility issues? I'd like to highlight =20=

the participation needs of disabled/isolated people, and encourage =20
more presentations/activities to include people communicating from a =20
distance, or at least to provide recorded info that can be downloaded.

I am going to be at GUADEC and I think Hanna was thinking about it but had a 
scheduling issue. I'd be happy to present a paper and/or recording, and if you'd 
like to work with me on preparing a paper that'd be awesome Clytie! :)
