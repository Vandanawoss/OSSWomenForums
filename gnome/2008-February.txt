Come to PyCon 2008 to:

    * meet interesting people in the Python community
    * learn about cool things others have done recently
    * show off the cool things you've done recently
    * learn about projects, tools & techniques
    * advance open source projects

A sampling of this year's talks:

  * Programming for the One Laptop Per Child laptop
  * Python-powered Multitouch
  * The State of Django
  * High performance Network IO with Python + Libevent
  * Developing, Testing, and Debugging Python Applications with Wing IDE

See http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/talks/ for the full list.

The day before the conference, the tutorial day features 28 different
three-hour tutorials, on topics such as Python 101, scientific
programming, SQLAlchemy, PyGame, and web tools such as Django,
Turbogears, and Plone.

After the conference, we have four days of sprints where project
developers can work together and introduce new developers.  Projects
sprinting this year include the Python interpreter, Jython, Django,
Turbogears, Bazaar, and Orbited.  Sprints are free, and anyone can
attend.
