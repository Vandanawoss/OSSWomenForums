Hi all!

We are starting an application process for the third round of GNOME Outreach Program for Women internships just in time for the Software Freedom Day!

The dates for these internships are December 12, 2011 to March 12, 2012. The application deadline is October 31, 2011. The internship dates are aimed at the college women in the Southern Hemisphere who will have a school summer break during this time. However, any woman who has relevant experience and is available for a full-time internship is welcome to apply.

Please check out all the program details here and consider applying for the program!
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2011

If you are heading to a Software Freedom Day event, please help us spread the word by bringing a few flyers there or making an announcement about the internship opportunities at the event. You can just tell people to check out the main GNOME website for more information.

You can also help us spread the word by sending the information about the program to the universities and organizations, posting the flyer on the university campuses or handing it out at conferences, encouraging anyone who'd be a good candidate to apply, or writing an update about the program on Identi.ca, Twitter, Facebook or Google+!

A flyer, a sample e-mail, and even a sample dent/tweet are here:

Thank you!
Marina
