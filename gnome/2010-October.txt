Outreach Program for Women

by: Marina Zhurakhinskaya

There seemed to be a stronger presence of women at GUADEC this year. We hel=
d the first women=E2=80=99s dinner at GUADEC which was attended by 15 women=
. Everyone really enjoyed meeting and talking to each other. Marina Zhurakh=
inskaya made short presentations to the GNOME Advisory Board and at the Ann=
ual General Meeting about the Outreach Program for Women (OPW) efforts.

We announced the OPW internships for December 15, 2010 to March 15, 2011 da=
tes on September 15. M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn Duffy designed a catchy flyer for the=
 program. Many members of the community helped spread the word by micro-blo=
gging, blogging, sending information to the universities, and handing out f=
lyers at conferences.

We are currently in the middle of the application process with the applicat=
ion deadline on October 25 and accepted participants announcement on Novemb=
er 3. We have already received a good number of applications and inquiries.=
 We should be able to accept at least five participants, with three being s=
ponsored by the GNOME Foundation and two being sponsored by Google. The fol=
lowing page contains all the information about the program: http://live.gno=
me.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2010

Stormy Peters attended the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing =
on September 28 - October 2. She organized the first Free and Open Source S=
oftware booth at the conference and participated in the Open Source Track. =
At the booth, they handed out 180 flyers about the GNOME Outreach Program f=
or Women as well as lots of GNOME stickers - the logo on a field of grass w=
as the most popular. Heidi Ellis also attended - her class at Western New E=
ngland College is working on Caribou as part of GNOME=E2=80=99s a11y and HF=
OSS program.

The FSF Womens' Caucus' =E2=80=9CBringing free software to girls and young =
women=E2=80=9D outreach program with the Girl Scouts of Eastern Massachuset=
ts and Red Hat has started. M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn Duffy taught the first class s=
ession on October 15. The class will run on a weekly basis through mid-Dece=
mber. Red Hat produced live USB keys with the GNOME-based Fedora Design Sui=
te that were distributed to the girls. Their first project involved photoma=
nipulation with Gimp. Future projects will involve Gimp, Inkscape, and othe=
r creative tools. This page contains more information about the course: htt=
p://libreplanet.org/wiki/Women%27s_Caucus/Girl_Scouts_Free_Software_Outreac=
h

In the next quarter, we look forward to working with the OPW internships pa=
rticipants and introducing them to the community.
