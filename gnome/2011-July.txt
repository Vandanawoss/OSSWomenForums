Hi everyone, this seems like as good a time as any to introduce myself. I'm
Sarah, and I'm working on my master's thesis right now and collecting
interviews about women in open source communities. I'm sending along my
official recruitment letter, so feel free to forward this to anyone that yo=
u
think may want to talk about the topic with me.

Thanks for considering!
Sarah

-------------------------
My name is Sarah Riggs and I am a Master's Degree seeking candidate at the
School of Information and Library Science at UNC Chapel Hill. I am
conducting research which addresses the large gender gap in the open source
community.

In 2006, a team of researchers sought to capture an image of women
contributors to open source software, as it was clear that women made up a
very small minority of participants (Nafus, Leach, & Kriegar, 2006). Severa=
l
proactive members of your community then implemented programs aimed at
increasing the number of women in open source; however, little research has
been done since this study.

By conducting qualitative interviews, my intention is to collect narratives
about the experiences of open source participants. I will ask questions
about your experiences joining and participating in the open source
community. Your answers will be used to to identify ways in which more wome=
n
can feel comfortable joining the community and contributing to open source
software development.

I would like to hear thoughts from women as well as men who are open source
contributors. Please consider participating whether you are just starting
out, or have been contributing to open source for many years. it is
important for this research to obtain a diverse group of respondents with
varied backgrounds so this research constructs a representative narrative o=
f
experience.

I will be conducting interviews through July 30th, 2011, and I will be happ=
y
to meet you at a time and date at your convenience. Those volunteers who ar=
e
selected will be allowed to decide the method of participation, and phone
calls, face-to-face interaction, or Internet Relay Chat are valid means of
communication.

Exhaustive efforts will be made to ensure that any information you give me
is confidential, and you are always free to stop the interview at any time.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions. I ca=
n
be best reached by e-mail, *smriggs@email.unc.edu*

Thank you for your time,
Sarah Riggs

Hi all!

It would be great to have a women's dinner at the Desktop Summit, similar to the one we had last year at GUADEC. I was thinking we could have it on Sunday, August 7 or Monday, August 8 at 6:30pm. Please let me know as soon as possible if you are coming to the Desktop Summit and would be interested in attending a dinner. Would either evening work for you?

We will also try to plan a BoF together with KDE women, so that we can all meet each other and discuss women outreach efforts.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be attending, as this will help in planning the events. If you are local, and can suggest a reasonably quiet and inexpensive restaurant near the venue that would accommodate a large group that would be great!

Thanks,
Marina

Hello everybody!

Marina, that sounds great, I was thinking about this too and I am happy
that you had the initiative. Last year, I had really a lot of fun :))).

I would suggest to do this on Monday. On Sunday there is going to be the
big DS party, and I consider that it would be nice to be able to have
some rest/shower/etc... before it.

I live in Berlin and would not mind to find a place where we can all
enjoy our dinner, if you confirm with enough time, let's say... before
the 21st July?. There are not many places around the venue where we can
choose and we might have to go to some other part of the city, but I
will figure it out.

Do you agree, ladies?

Patricia.

Hello!

I'll be at the Desktop Summit on Saturday and Sunday (not directly involved in Gnome/KDE development but co-organised Libre Graphics Meeting 2010 and active in Les Samedies, a women and Free Software group in Brussels). If it happens to work out on Sunday, I'd love to join; if not: enjoy dinner :-)

best,


Femke

Hi!

Outreach Program for Women quarterly update for Q2 is below. You can also f=
ind it on:
https://live.gnome.org/GnomeMarketing/QuarterlyReports/2011/Q2

Some overlap with the Q1 update is due to some news that belongs to Q2 alre=
ady being available at the time of writing of the Q1 update. Please let me =
know if you'd like to add anything!

Note the great news that the GNOME Foundation has approved funding for two =
more rounds of the internships!

For those attending the Desktop Summit, the GNOME women's dinner will take =
place on Monday, August 8. I will soon send out an e-mail with the time and=
 place. The Women's Networking BoF has been scheduled for 6pm on Tuesday, A=
ugust 9. Please add your name to the wiki page if you are planning to atten=
d!

BoF

Thanks,

Outreach Program for Women

by: Marina Zhurakhinskaya

Thanks to generous sponsors, Collabora, Google, Mozilla and the GNOME Found=
ation, GNOME was able to accept eight strong participants for the new round=
 of internships that are taking place between May 23 and August 22, 2011. S=
etting the same application dates for this round of OPW internships as the =
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) application dates proved to be a successful st=
rategy for encouraging more women to apply for GSoC in GNOME. In addition t=
o the eight OPW interns, there are seven female interns among the 27 GSoC i=
nterns in GNOME. This is an unprecedented number of female GSoC participant=
s in GNOME, as it had at most one female participant in some of the previou=
s years. All women who applied for GSoC in 2011 found mentors and project i=
deas, made a first contribution, and navigated the application process with=
 the help of the resources available through the OPW.

The OPW interns, as well as their location, project, and mentor(s), are:

  * Aline Duarte Bessa, Salvador, Brazil =E2=80=93 Accessibility, Documenta=

The press release [1] and the program details page [2] have more informatio=
n about the program. The list of GNOME projects that participate in the pro=
gram has grown to 13, and more projects are encouraged to join in!

The GNOME Foundation has approved funding for two more rounds of the Outrea=
ch Program for Women internships with at least three participants each. The=
 next round will take place between December 2011 and March 2012. The appli=
cation deadline for this round will be in the end of October 2011. We will =
soon update the information on the wiki about the internships and will open=
 the application period.

The Desktop Summit is the big event for the GNOME community in the next qua=
rter. It will be taking place August 6-12 in Berlin, Germany. Eleven Outrea=
ch Program for Women interns from the past two rounds of the program will b=
e attending the event. They will do lightning talks about their work during=
 the GNOME and KDE Interns Showcase [3] session. First round's intern Chand=
ni Verma will do a talk Knock Knock! What is new? [4] about her experience =
with the program and contributions to Empathy. Encouraged by the last year'=
s great GNOME women's dinner experience, we will gather for another one thi=
s year, making it an annual tradition. There will also be a Women's Network=
ing BoF [5] that will allow GNOME and KDE women to meet each other and talk=
 about the work they are doing, how they started contributing, and the wome=
n outreach efforts in both projects.

Thanks, Marina!

Hey, have you read an email I sent you asking about documentation for an US
Visa? I intend to go to US GNOME events as soon as possible, but I need the
visa. =/

Perhaps, when the next event date is set, you could send me a digital letter
telling that I participated of a GNOME program and intend to go to the US
because of a GNOME event?

Best regards!

Hi Aline!

Sorry I missed your last e-mail.

I think you just need the tourist visa. What is the processing time that is stated for that? If you want to try to find someone who obtained the visa in the past to attend a GNOME event in the US you can try asking on the GNOME Brazil list:
http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-br-list

The Boston Summit will most likely be held October 8-10. I don't think you need to wait until the dates are officially announced to start the visa application process, especially if it requires a long time. Can you please e-mail Brian Cameron (brian.cameron@oracle.com), who is the GNOME Foundation secretary, and ask him to send you an invitation letter for the Boston Summit. He has the official GNOME Foundation template for such letters. Feel free to CC me and Joanie on your e-mail.

Thanks,
Marina

Hi Marina, Hi Aline,

Brazilians don't need visa to enter into European Community. The visa
is given in board landing.

For US need B1-B2 visa for conferences/events or B2 for tourism.

My tiny help...

Izabel

is stated for that? If you want to try to find someone who obtained the vis=
a in the past to attend a GNOME event in the US you can try asking on the G=
NOME Brazil list:

 secretary, and ask him to send you an invitation letter for the Boston Sum=
