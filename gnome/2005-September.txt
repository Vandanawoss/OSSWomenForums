Hi everybody :)

Sorry I haven't been active here: once Gnome finishes this release, =20
life will calm down to something approaching normality, and I can do =20
some of the things I have on my ToDo list, where G-W features =20
prominently. :)

I was just having a very quick look at the minutes of the Gnome =20
Foundation board meeting ... and noticed there isn't a single woman =20
on the board. :(

I wonder if, firstly, we can get some stats on how many women there =20
are in the Gnome Foundation to start with, and secondly, if we can =20
start encouraging more women to join, and thus build up some =20
probability that we might get a woman on the board.

What do you think?

Even though there are those who are GNOME members...

It would be nice to see GNOME Women taking the lead in getting the
developers to apply for membership to the GNOME Foundation. Getting a
woman on board is not directly related to having women as members, but I
would sure love to see that happen this time around.

It would be great, wouldn't it, Sankarshan? I wonder how we can help =20
make this happen ... I know the constraint is always available time, =20
but maybe we can get together some names of Gnome Women, and each =20
approach a few and encourage them, firstly to apply for membership of =20=

the foundation, and secondly, ask if they'd be interested in running =20
for a place on the board, or know of anyone who would be interested.

The difficult thing about a large online community like this, with =20
everyone working hard at their own aspects of it, is that we don't =20
really have a whole-community view of who's involved. I have some =20
picture of the translation area, where I spend most of my time in =20
Gnome, but I don't really know anyone outside that, apart from =20
here :), and people who appear briefly on the translation list for =20
individual purposes.

I don't know how we create a central identity in the first place, let =20=

alone get a view of it for all of us which shows us what we, women, =20
are doing in Gnome, who we all are and what we want to do. Although =20
we talk of being a community, we're really an assembly of lots of =20
smaller communities, so it's hard to gain interest in any issue which =20=

concerns the umbrella structure. How would we encourage people to =20
vote for a specific candidate, in this case, a Gnome-Woman?

We need a way to reach women in Gnome, get this Gnome-Women network =20
working for us. It's a terrific idea, and we're creating some =20
excellent resources. (I don't mean, get it working only for this =20
issue, but in general, make it not only a part of life for women in =20
Gnome, but an identity, a central strength that is all of us working =20
together.)

How, is another matter. :S

This is just a general ramble, not a policy of any kind. ;)  I'm =20
trying to get my head around the situation. Anyone who finds pieces =20
of my head, please superglue them on the appropriate mount point. ;) =20
Thankyou.

Hi guys,

Just wanted to shout out that Diana and I are going to be at the GNOME
Summit at MIT. I heard in the channel that ChipX86, spooklight, and jdub
are going to be there too.

If you're in the Boston area (or can get there easily) that weekend,
here are some details:

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005  is the main page;

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005_2fTheSchedule current schedule of
events;

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005_2fBreakoutSessions list of breakout
session suggestions, if there's enough interest maybe we could hold one
for GNOME Women?

Better suggestion - why don't one of you give a talk?  I for one would
like to hear about initiatives in-place (not just in Gnome-Women but all
other Open Source and technology groups) and the reasons for needing
such initiatives.  A brief overview of the history of woman in
technology and their contributions to Gnome (direct or indirect) and why
it is so important that we keep encouraging these contributions would be
very informative.

If anything I encourage you do the 5 minute speed talk but a full length
talk would be even better.

Hi everybody :)

Sorry I haven't been active here: once Gnome finishes this release, =20
life will calm down to something approaching normality, and I can do =20
some of the things I have on my ToDo list, where G-W features =20
prominently. :)

I was just having a very quick look at the minutes of the Gnome =20
Foundation board meeting ... and noticed there isn't a single woman =20
on the board. :(

I wonder if, firstly, we can get some stats on how many women there =20
are in the Gnome Foundation to start with, and secondly, if we can =20
start encouraging more women to join, and thus build up some =20
probability that we might get a woman on the board.

What do you think?

Even though there are those who are GNOME members...

It would be nice to see GNOME Women taking the lead in getting the
developers to apply for membership to the GNOME Foundation. Getting a
woman on board is not directly related to having women as members, but I
would sure love to see that happen this time around.

It would be great, wouldn't it, Sankarshan? I wonder how we can help =20
make this happen ... I know the constraint is always available time, =20
but maybe we can get together some names of Gnome Women, and each =20
approach a few and encourage them, firstly to apply for membership of =20=

the foundation, and secondly, ask if they'd be interested in running =20
for a place on the board, or know of anyone who would be interested.

The difficult thing about a large online community like this, with =20
everyone working hard at their own aspects of it, is that we don't =20
really have a whole-community view of who's involved. I have some =20
picture of the translation area, where I spend most of my time in =20
Gnome, but I don't really know anyone outside that, apart from =20
here :), and people who appear briefly on the translation list for =20
individual purposes.

I don't know how we create a central identity in the first place, let =20=

alone get a view of it for all of us which shows us what we, women, =20
are doing in Gnome, who we all are and what we want to do. Although =20
we talk of being a community, we're really an assembly of lots of =20
smaller communities, so it's hard to gain interest in any issue which =20=

concerns the umbrella structure. How would we encourage people to =20
vote for a specific candidate, in this case, a Gnome-Woman?

We need a way to reach women in Gnome, get this Gnome-Women network =20
working for us. It's a terrific idea, and we're creating some =20
excellent resources. (I don't mean, get it working only for this =20
issue, but in general, make it not only a part of life for women in =20
Gnome, but an identity, a central strength that is all of us working =20
together.)

How, is another matter. :S

This is just a general ramble, not a policy of any kind. ;)  I'm =20
trying to get my head around the situation. Anyone who finds pieces =20
of my head, please superglue them on the appropriate mount point. ;) =20
Thankyou.

Hi guys,

Just wanted to shout out that Diana and I are going to be at the GNOME
Summit at MIT. I heard in the channel that ChipX86, spooklight, and jdub
are going to be there too.

If you're in the Boston area (or can get there easily) that weekend,
here are some details:

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005  is the main page;

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005_2fTheSchedule current schedule of
events;

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005_2fBreakoutSessions list of breakout
session suggestions, if there's enough interest maybe we could hold one
for GNOME Women?

Better suggestion - why don't one of you give a talk?  I for one would
like to hear about initiatives in-place (not just in Gnome-Women but all
other Open Source and technology groups) and the reasons for needing
such initiatives.  A brief overview of the history of woman in
technology and their contributions to Gnome (direct or indirect) and why
it is so important that we keep encouraging these contributions would be
very informative.

If anything I encourage you do the 5 minute speed talk but a full length
talk would be even better.

Hi everybody :)

Sorry I haven't been active here: once Gnome finishes this release, =20
life will calm down to something approaching normality, and I can do =20
some of the things I have on my ToDo list, where G-W features =20
prominently. :)

I was just having a very quick look at the minutes of the Gnome =20
Foundation board meeting ... and noticed there isn't a single woman =20
on the board. :(

I wonder if, firstly, we can get some stats on how many women there =20
are in the Gnome Foundation to start with, and secondly, if we can =20
start encouraging more women to join, and thus build up some =20
probability that we might get a woman on the board.

What do you think?

Even though there are those who are GNOME members...

It would be nice to see GNOME Women taking the lead in getting the
developers to apply for membership to the GNOME Foundation. Getting a
woman on board is not directly related to having women as members, but I
would sure love to see that happen this time around.

It would be great, wouldn't it, Sankarshan? I wonder how we can help =20
make this happen ... I know the constraint is always available time, =20
but maybe we can get together some names of Gnome Women, and each =20
approach a few and encourage them, firstly to apply for membership of =20=

the foundation, and secondly, ask if they'd be interested in running =20
for a place on the board, or know of anyone who would be interested.

The difficult thing about a large online community like this, with =20
everyone working hard at their own aspects of it, is that we don't =20
really have a whole-community view of who's involved. I have some =20
picture of the translation area, where I spend most of my time in =20
Gnome, but I don't really know anyone outside that, apart from =20
here :), and people who appear briefly on the translation list for =20
individual purposes.

I don't know how we create a central identity in the first place, let =20=

alone get a view of it for all of us which shows us what we, women, =20
are doing in Gnome, who we all are and what we want to do. Although =20
we talk of being a community, we're really an assembly of lots of =20
smaller communities, so it's hard to gain interest in any issue which =20=

concerns the umbrella structure. How would we encourage people to =20
vote for a specific candidate, in this case, a Gnome-Woman?

We need a way to reach women in Gnome, get this Gnome-Women network =20
working for us. It's a terrific idea, and we're creating some =20
excellent resources. (I don't mean, get it working only for this =20
issue, but in general, make it not only a part of life for women in =20
Gnome, but an identity, a central strength that is all of us working =20
together.)

How, is another matter. :S

This is just a general ramble, not a policy of any kind. ;)  I'm =20
trying to get my head around the situation. Anyone who finds pieces =20
of my head, please superglue them on the appropriate mount point. ;) =20
Thankyou.

Hi guys,

Just wanted to shout out that Diana and I are going to be at the GNOME
Summit at MIT. I heard in the channel that ChipX86, spooklight, and jdub
are going to be there too.

If you're in the Boston area (or can get there easily) that weekend,
here are some details:

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005  is the main page;

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005_2fTheSchedule current schedule of
events;

http://live.gnome.org/Boston2005_2fBreakoutSessions list of breakout
session suggestions, if there's enough interest maybe we could hold one
for GNOME Women?

Better suggestion - why don't one of you give a talk?  I for one would
like to hear about initiatives in-place (not just in Gnome-Women but all
other Open Source and technology groups) and the reasons for needing
such initiatives.  A brief overview of the history of woman in
technology and their contributions to Gnome (direct or indirect) and why
it is so important that we keep encouraging these contributions would be
very informative.

If anything I encourage you do the 5 minute speed talk but a full length
talk would be even better.
