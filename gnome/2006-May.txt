Hi everyone,

The final report from the FLOSSPOLS study on gender and free software
is now online:
http://www.flosspols.org/deliverables/FLOSSPOLS-D16-Gender_Integrated_Report_of_Findings.pdf
The recommendations are online too:
http://www.flosspols.org/deliverables/FLOSSPOLS-D17-Gender_Policy_Recommendations.pdf
I gave a talk about the FLOSSPOLS findings at FOSDEM back in February
-- my slides are also (finally!) online at
http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~hmw26/talks/fosdem2006.pdf.

Lastly, there are a number of interesting blog posts about women in
free software, and in particular, GNOME. Check 'em out:

I sent this to gnome-women@gnome.org instead of gnome-women-list@gnome.org. 
Trying again with some updates.

I created a general mentoring page. Hopefully it will fill up:
http://live.gnome.org/MentoredProjects
But the above questions remain.

I'm really glad to see we're doing something focussed to encourage =20
female participation in Gnome. :)

Potentially awkward. :(

We need to make gender recording optional: some people aren't happy =20
with being told to log their gender, and some don't fit in the binary =20=

male/female classification.

A checkbox item like:

We are keen to make GNOME an environment where gender doesn't define =20
your opportunities. In doing this, it really helps if we know who's =20
participating: we can evaluate our program and improve it. You don't =20
have to give us this information, but we'd really appreciate it if =20
you would. Thankyou. :)

Gender stats

I identify myself as

[ ]	male
[ ]	female
[ ]	currently neither
[ ]	I do not wish to give this information

We know gender is a spectrum, including many very complex situations =20
which we don't really understand well enough to describe here. If you =20=

can help us make GNOME a friendlier place for people like you, please =20=

email gender_all@gnome.org

As long as you're careful and considerate about the gender spectrum =20
and privacy, as above (which is only an approximation: somebody can =20
probably do it much better than I can), it could be useful.

Funnel it through Gnome-women and a mentors listing. We can refer =20
people to you and help support them.

Good in general. We discussed this on Ubuntu-Women recently, and were =20=

concerned that anyone listed as a mentor is recommended personally as =20=

having the skills and attitude needed.

YES. Plus a procedure for reporting and managing breaches of it.

Good start. :)

OK, I've added myself (mentor for female translators). This is part =20
of something I'm doing through the network of women-in-computing =20
groups, and hope to continue for some time, through a number of =20
practical applications of our work. I'm happy to focus part of that =20
at Gnome.

Anything that publicizes our participation. Example is very =20
motivating. The Profiles page at Debian-Women is a good example of =20
this sort of work.

I think most of us would much rather be anonymous. We often, um, hide =20=

behind male or non-easily-gendered names so we won't be classified. =20
This isn't only about avoiding hostility, but also about personality: =20=

we're not public people.

However, there is a real need for r=C3=B4le-models here, so we need to =20=

work up some courage and step forward.

I can't appear anywhere like GUADEC, since I'm bedridden and can't =20
travel, except electronically ;) , but I'll do what I can.

What's our timeline on GUADEC now? Ma=C3=ADrin and Anca, we could =
combine =20
some of this discussion with our paper (we need to get that started).

I suggest that we keep this simple for now, but feel free to reply to the
thread on foundation-list. I won't be the one actually implementing this.

At the moment, I guess that a whole beaurocratic structure to handle
problems would be hard to get going and would make this appear less
attractive. Plus people would tend to leave all "enforcement" up to the
beaurocracy instead of just saying "Hey, that's not good. It's really
against our code of conduct".

I think Ubuntu's code of conduct is successful because of the expectations
that it creates rather than the organizational structure it creates. I
would like GNOME's Code Of Conduct to be simpler.

I don't mean anything heavy or detailed. But you do need somewhere to =20=

I hope that all the women on this list are already members of the GNOME
Foundation. If not, I encourage you to become members:
http://foundation.gnome.org/membership/

Also, planet.gnome.org is probably the most visible part of the GNOME
community. If you contribute to GNOME at all and you have a blog, please
do ask Jeff to add it to the planet.

If you don't have a blog yet, you might want to get one at
blogs.gnome.org. gnome-web-list@gnome.org is probably the best place to
ask about getting a blogs.gnome.org blog, though I think Jonathan
Blandford is the admin for the blogs.

I would not like to specifically draw attention or tout my gender
(which should not matter and nor is it a secret as such :-)) but it
will be nicer if gender recording were optional.

Besides the technical expertise, a combination of patience and
consideration for a new mentee helps greatly.

Hi everyone,

The final report from the FLOSSPOLS study on gender and free software
is now online:
http://www.flosspols.org/deliverables/FLOSSPOLS-D16-Gender_Integrated_Report_of_Findings.pdf
The recommendations are online too:
http://www.flosspols.org/deliverables/FLOSSPOLS-D17-Gender_Policy_Recommendations.pdf
I gave a talk about the FLOSSPOLS findings at FOSDEM back in February
-- my slides are also (finally!) online at
http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~hmw26/talks/fosdem2006.pdf.

Lastly, there are a number of interesting blog posts about women in
free software, and in particular, GNOME. Check 'em out:

I sent this to gnome-women@gnome.org instead of gnome-women-list@gnome.org. 
Trying again with some updates.

I created a general mentoring page. Hopefully it will fill up:
http://live.gnome.org/MentoredProjects
But the above questions remain.

I'm really glad to see we're doing something focussed to encourage =20
female participation in Gnome. :)

Potentially awkward. :(

We need to make gender recording optional: some people aren't happy =20
with being told to log their gender, and some don't fit in the binary =20=

male/female classification.

A checkbox item like:

We are keen to make GNOME an environment where gender doesn't define =20
your opportunities. In doing this, it really helps if we know who's =20
participating: we can evaluate our program and improve it. You don't =20
have to give us this information, but we'd really appreciate it if =20
you would. Thankyou. :)

Gender stats

I identify myself as

[ ]	male
[ ]	female
[ ]	currently neither
[ ]	I do not wish to give this information

We know gender is a spectrum, including many very complex situations =20
which we don't really understand well enough to describe here. If you =20=

can help us make GNOME a friendlier place for people like you, please =20=

email gender_all@gnome.org

As long as you're careful and considerate about the gender spectrum =20
and privacy, as above (which is only an approximation: somebody can =20
probably do it much better than I can), it could be useful.

Funnel it through Gnome-women and a mentors listing. We can refer =20
people to you and help support them.

Good in general. We discussed this on Ubuntu-Women recently, and were =20=

concerned that anyone listed as a mentor is recommended personally as =20=

having the skills and attitude needed.

YES. Plus a procedure for reporting and managing breaches of it.

Good start. :)

OK, I've added myself (mentor for female translators). This is part =20
of something I'm doing through the network of women-in-computing =20
groups, and hope to continue for some time, through a number of =20
practical applications of our work. I'm happy to focus part of that =20
at Gnome.

Anything that publicizes our participation. Example is very =20
motivating. The Profiles page at Debian-Women is a good example of =20
this sort of work.

I think most of us would much rather be anonymous. We often, um, hide =20=

behind male or non-easily-gendered names so we won't be classified. =20
This isn't only about avoiding hostility, but also about personality: =20=

we're not public people.

However, there is a real need for r=C3=B4le-models here, so we need to =20=

work up some courage and step forward.

I can't appear anywhere like GUADEC, since I'm bedridden and can't =20
travel, except electronically ;) , but I'll do what I can.

What's our timeline on GUADEC now? Ma=C3=ADrin and Anca, we could =
combine =20
some of this discussion with our paper (we need to get that started).

I suggest that we keep this simple for now, but feel free to reply to the
thread on foundation-list. I won't be the one actually implementing this.

At the moment, I guess that a whole beaurocratic structure to handle
problems would be hard to get going and would make this appear less
attractive. Plus people would tend to leave all "enforcement" up to the
beaurocracy instead of just saying "Hey, that's not good. It's really
against our code of conduct".

I think Ubuntu's code of conduct is successful because of the expectations
that it creates rather than the organizational structure it creates. I
would like GNOME's Code Of Conduct to be simpler.

I don't mean anything heavy or detailed. But you do need somewhere to =20=

I hope that all the women on this list are already members of the GNOME
Foundation. If not, I encourage you to become members:
http://foundation.gnome.org/membership/

Also, planet.gnome.org is probably the most visible part of the GNOME
community. If you contribute to GNOME at all and you have a blog, please
do ask Jeff to add it to the planet.

If you don't have a blog yet, you might want to get one at
blogs.gnome.org. gnome-web-list@gnome.org is probably the best place to
ask about getting a blogs.gnome.org blog, though I think Jonathan
Blandford is the admin for the blogs.

I would not like to specifically draw attention or tout my gender
(which should not matter and nor is it a secret as such :-)) but it
will be nicer if gender recording were optional.

Besides the technical expertise, a combination of patience and
consideration for a new mentee helps greatly.

Hi everyone,

The final report from the FLOSSPOLS study on gender and free software
is now online:
http://www.flosspols.org/deliverables/FLOSSPOLS-D16-Gender_Integrated_Report_of_Findings.pdf
The recommendations are online too:
http://www.flosspols.org/deliverables/FLOSSPOLS-D17-Gender_Policy_Recommendations.pdf
I gave a talk about the FLOSSPOLS findings at FOSDEM back in February
-- my slides are also (finally!) online at
http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~hmw26/talks/fosdem2006.pdf.

Lastly, there are a number of interesting blog posts about women in
free software, and in particular, GNOME. Check 'em out:

I created a general mentoring page. Hopefully it will fill up:
http://live.gnome.org/MentoredProjects
But the above questions remain.

I'm really glad to see we're doing something focussed to encourage =20
female participation in Gnome. :)

Potentially awkward. :(

We need to make gender recording optional: some people aren't happy =20
with being told to log their gender, and some don't fit in the binary =20=

male/female classification.

A checkbox item like:

participating: we can evaluate our program and improve it. You don't =20

you would. Thankyou. :)

Gender stats

I identify myself as

[ ]	male
[ ]	female
[ ]	currently neither
[ ]	I do not wish to give this information

We know gender is a spectrum, including many very complex situations =20
which we don't really understand well enough to describe here. If you =20=

can help us make GNOME a friendlier place for people like you, please =20=

email gender_all@gnome.org

As long as you're careful and considerate about the gender spectrum =20
and privacy, as above (which is only an approximation: somebody can =20
probably do it much better than I can), it could be useful.

Funnel it through Gnome-women and a mentors listing. We can refer =20
people to you and help support them.

Good in general. We discussed this on Ubuntu-Women recently, and were =20=

concerned that anyone listed as a mentor is recommended personally as =20=

having the skills and attitude needed.

YES. Plus a procedure for reporting and managing breaches of it.

Good start. :)

OK, I've added myself (mentor for female translators). This is part =20
of something I'm doing through the network of women-in-computing =20
groups, and hope to continue for some time, through a number of =20
practical applications of our work. I'm happy to focus part of that =20
at Gnome.

Anything that publicizes our participation. Example is very =20
motivating. The Profiles page at Debian-Women is a good example of =20
this sort of work.

I think most of us would much rather be anonymous. We often, um, hide =20=

behind male or non-easily-gendered names so we won't be classified. =20
This isn't only about avoiding hostility, but also about personality: =20=

we're not public people.

However, there is a real need for r=C3=B4le-models here, so we need to =20=

work up some courage and step forward.

I can't appear anywhere like GUADEC, since I'm bedridden and can't =20
travel, except electronically ;) , but I'll do what I can.

What's our timeline on GUADEC now? Ma=C3=ADrin and Anca, we could =
combine =20
some of this discussion with our paper (we need to get that started).

I suggest that we keep this simple for now, but feel free to reply to the
thread on foundation-list. I won't be the one actually implementing this.

I don't think this requires changes to the privacy policy as long as it's

At the moment, I guess that a whole beaurocratic structure to handle
problems would be hard to get going and would make this appear less
attractive. Plus people would tend to leave all "enforcement" up to the
beaurocracy instead of just saying "Hey, that's not good. It's really
against our code of conduct".

I think Ubuntu's code of conduct is successful because of the expectations

I hope that all the women on this list are already members of the GNOME
Foundation. If not, I encourage you to become members:
http://foundation.gnome.org/membership/

Also, planet.gnome.org is probably the most visible part of the GNOME
community. If you contribute to GNOME at all and you have a blog, please
do ask Jeff to add it to the planet.

If you don't have a blog yet, you might want to get one at
blogs.gnome.org. gnome-web-list@gnome.org is probably the best place to
ask about getting a blogs.gnome.org blog, though I think Jonathan
Blandford is the admin for the blogs.

I would not like to specifically draw attention or tout my gender
(which should not matter and nor is it a secret as such :-)) but it
will be nicer if gender recording were optional.

Besides the technical expertise, a combination of patience and
consideration for a new mentee helps greatly.
