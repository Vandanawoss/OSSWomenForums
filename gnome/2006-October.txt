Hi all,

For those of you who don't know yet, I just wanted to congratulate
GNOME-Women members Clytie Siddall and Izabel Cerqueira on becoming the
two newest members of the GNOME foundation membership committee - it's a
thankless job, but one which is hugely important, and I would like to
welcome them both on board.

It's great to see a committee as central as this for the foundation
become more geographically and gender diverse.

Cheers,
Dave.

Hi Clytie,

Clytie Siddall wrote:

I'll let Baris and Sankharshan go into the details, but the short
version is that the membership committee evaluates whether someone who
applies for GNOME Foundation membership gets it. They also handle
membership renewal, and keep a list of eligible foundation voters for
elections.

In the past, we've had trouble handling local user group requests and
some non-technical contributions. The tone of the membership committee
has on occasion also suffered from being a little terse/prosaic/blunt
(pick your favourite) - hopefully, bring in new members will speed up
the approval/rejection of membership requests, and give the process the
human touch it needs. There's a fine line to walk between being
all-embracing (at the risk of making GNOME foundation membership
meaningless) and pushing away potentially great members.

Cheers,
Dave.

All the stuff that keeps the kitchen clean and the house tidy. It is a
fun job and we really look forward to getting more and more members and
at the same time push the turnaround time down as much as we can.

Hmm...Dave's being polite really ;) The usual issues we have range from
we are being too harsh to we are taking far too long to fulfill a
membership request.

However, fear not. We have taken the sword of efficient functioning to
our way of doing things and right now we have a spiffy system (and
toolset) that's just what the doctor ordered. These allow you to provide
love where it is most required and make the membership a good thing for
a lot of folks (if you don't believe that just check p.g.o for some nice
blog entries from deserving and great new members). All in all, a good
day's work just makes your heart fly.

In the end, I would like to tell you that no contribution to GNOME is
too small and would request that if you feel that you can contribute to
GNOME through becoming a member for your efforts - please join in.

Regards
Sankarshan

Yes, I can see that. I've worked in community projects, so I'd be =20
happy to encourage people to join, and to help in general. I think =20
Gnome has a good "feel", and we can base our efforts on that. I'd be =20
delighted to get some people from my own community to take that step =20
into the mainstream ...

*clytie starts envisioning persuasive emails*

and I think there are some Gnome Women who minimize their =20
contributions. :)

All in all, it's an exciting prospect. :D

Cool. Where can we play with, um, assess these tools? ... [reading =20
wiki docs] https://mango.gnome.org/

Will any of our existing logins work for this? And do our existing =20
CVS accounts work for the gnome-foundation module? I just tried =20
checking it out, but I can't find it. Its not at root level. Which =20
module is concealing it sneakily from my cvs client?

That's a good message for us to propagate. :)

Should we take more detailed questions (access, actions) onto the =20
membership-committee list?

I tend to ask a lot of questions until I can get things worked out =20
satisfactorily in what's left of my brain, so I hope that's OK. In =20
any case, the female thinking model (cluster-burst thinking) is to =20

there will be questions. Your documentation, though, is very =20
informative. It answered most of mine first up. :)

Anyone from this list going to linux.conf.au will probably also be
interested in the GNOME event: http://live.gnome.org/Sydney2007

That's a shame, we're going to lose a lot of excellent speakers due to
not being able to provide financial assistance. (linux.conf.au only
provides travel assistance to speakers accepted in the main track.)

We're hoping that this event proves to be a success and that people can
replicate it in their local communities or perhaps that something
similar can be run on a larger scale at a later date. Since this is the
first trial of the idea that I'm aware of, we're starting small.

Hi all,

I am working on Govt. funded project and being a woman with small kid have
been playing very crucial role in ICT development in India, so have lots of
things to share and discuss with all of you.

Unfortunately it won't be possible for me to attend the event without full
financial support :-(

Probably I would be missing an opportunity.....

Hi all,

For those of you who don't know yet, I just wanted to congratulate
GNOME-Women members Clytie Siddall and Izabel Cerqueira on becoming the
two newest members of the GNOME foundation membership committee - it's a
thankless job, but one which is hugely important, and I would like to
welcome them both on board.

It's great to see a committee as central as this for the foundation
become more geographically and gender diverse.

Cheers,
Dave.

Hi Clytie,

Clytie Siddall wrote:
> What do you need us to do?

I'll let Baris and Sankharshan go into the details, but the short
version is that the membership committee evaluates whether someone who
applies for GNOME Foundation membership gets it. They also handle
membership renewal, and keep a list of eligible foundation voters for
elections.

In the past, we've had trouble handling local user group requests and
some non-technical contributions. The tone of the membership committee
has on occasion also suffered from being a little terse/prosaic/blunt
(pick your favourite) - hopefully, bring in new members will speed up
the approval/rejection of membership requests, and give the process the
human touch it needs. There's a fine line to walk between being
all-embracing (at the risk of making GNOME foundation membership
meaningless) and pushing away potentially great members.

Cheers,
Dave.

All the stuff that keeps the kitchen clean and the house tidy. It is a
fun job and we really look forward to getting more and more members and
at the same time push the turnaround time down as much as we can.

Hmm...Dave's being polite really ;) The usual issues we have range from
we are being too harsh to we are taking far too long to fulfill a
membership request.

However, fear not. We have taken the sword of efficient functioning to
our way of doing things and right now we have a spiffy system (and
toolset) that's just what the doctor ordered. These allow you to provide
love where it is most required and make the membership a good thing for
a lot of folks (if you don't believe that just check p.g.o for some nice
blog entries from deserving and great new members). All in all, a good
day's work just makes your heart fly.

In the end, I would like to tell you that no contribution to GNOME is
too small and would request that if you feel that you can contribute to
GNOME through becoming a member for your efforts - please join in.

Regards
Sankarshan

Yes, I can see that. I've worked in community projects, so I'd be =20
happy to encourage people to join, and to help in general. I think =20
Gnome has a good "feel", and we can base our efforts on that. I'd be =20
delighted to get some people from my own community to take that step =20
into the mainstream ...

*clytie starts envisioning persuasive emails*

and I think there are some Gnome Women who minimize their =20
contributions. :)

All in all, it's an exciting prospect. :D

Cool. Where can we play with, um, assess these tools? ... [reading =20
wiki docs] https://mango.gnome.org/

Will any of our existing logins work for this? And do our existing =20
CVS accounts work for the gnome-foundation module? I just tried =20
checking it out, but I can't find it. Its not at root level. Which =20
module is concealing it sneakily from my cvs client?

That's a good message for us to propagate. :)

Should we take more detailed questions (access, actions) onto the =20
membership-committee list?

I tend to ask a lot of questions until I can get things worked out =20
satisfactorily in what's left of my brain, so I hope that's OK. In =20
any case, the female thinking model (cluster-burst thinking) is to =20
examine a situation from every aspect, and to trial those aspects, so =20=

there will be questions. Your documentation, though, is very =20
informative. It answered most of mine first up. :)

That's a shame, we're going to lose a lot of excellent speakers due to
not being able to provide financial assistance. (linux.conf.au only
provides travel assistance to speakers accepted in the main track.)

We're hoping that this event proves to be a success and that people can
replicate it in their local communities or perhaps that something
similar can be run on a larger scale at a later date. Since this is the
first trial of the idea that I'm aware of, we're starting small.

Hi all,

I am working on Govt. funded project and being a woman with small kid have
been playing very crucial role in ICT development in India, so have lots of
things to share and discuss with all of you.

Unfortunately it won't be possible for me to attend the event without full
financial support :-(

Probably I would be missing an opportunity.....
