Hi all!

We have opened the application process for the first round of internships f=
or women sponsored by the GNOME Foundation. The dates for these internships=
 are December 15, 2010 to March 15, 2011. These internship dates are aimed =
at the college women in the Southern Hemisphere who will have a school summ=
er break during this time. However, any woman who has relevant experience a=
nd is available for a full-time internship is welcome to apply.

The application deadline is October 25, 2010. As part of the application pr=
ocess, we are asking women to take the time to learn about the participatin=
g projects and make a contribution to the one they are interested in. These=
 projects include ones in programming, graphic design, documentation, and m=
arketing.

All the program details are here:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2010

We also have an awesome flyer for the program that was designed by M=C3=A1i=
r=C3=ADn Duffy:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2010?action=3DAttachFile&do=
=3Dview&target=3Dgnome-women-outreach-poster.png

Please consider applying for the internship, signing up as a mentor, or hel=
ping us spread the word! It would be particularly great if those of you who=
 are in the Southern Hemisphere can send the information about the program =
to the universities and organizations, post the flyer on the university cam=
puses or hand it out at conferences, and encourage anyone who'd be a good c=
andidate to apply!

All the materials for helping us spread the word are here:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2010/SpreadTheWord

Thank you!
Marina

Hi Marina,

I spread this message on SFD this Saturday. Female students in Beijing are
very exited about this program. There are some questions from them and me;
1. It seems the program is for Southern Hemisphere, can students from other
places apply for this program? Is it a world wide program ?
2. How many interns we plan to accept this year ?
3. For a students, what's the next step after sending her application form?
If there are 10 applications form for one project, is there further
interview process to select the candidates ?

I also talked with Chinese company, what if one company want to
participated/sponsor in this program? What's the process like?
1. Do the company propose one project ?
2. Do they offer mentors to the project ?
3. What's the sponsorship fee like for this program?


Thanks.
Emily

I believe most programs similar to the Gnome one (think gsoc,
ruby-soc, etc...) are international** in scope. On first read, the
word "Southern Hemisphere" in the flyer does sound like its target
audience is women-folk from AU, NZ, etc....  its presumably meant to
encourage them to apply in larger numbers as per their
school/university schedule. I doubt if its intended to keep folks from
other regions from applying, at least its not explicitly mentioned :)

** Most projects have FAQ's for information on specific country
restrictions, ex. Gsoc has a list of countries whose residents cant
participate. I'm not aware of specific Gnome project rules.

We are targeting the southern hemisphere with this one and then we will run
another round during the summer of of the northern hemisphere. However,
anyone who is free during those times can apply, regardless of where they
live.

I'm not sure. But we do expect students to submit a patch as part of their
process. So they should be encouraged to participate.

That would be great!

It is flexible. If they have a project and a mentor, that would be great. If
they would like to fund a specific project or task, that would work too. We
can find mentors. Or they can just sponsor with funding.

It's $4500/student/project. We will take donations in any size.

Call for proposals -- PyCon 2011 -- <http://us.pycon.org/2011/>
===============================================================

Proposal Due date: November 1st, 2010

PyCon is back! With a rocking new website, a great location and more
Python hackers and luminaries under one roof than you could possibly
shake a stick at. We've also added an "Extreme" talk track this year -
no introduction, no fluff - only the pure technical meat!

PyCon 2011 will be held March 9th through the 17th, 2011 in Atlanta,
Georgia. (Home of some of the best southern food you can possibly find
on Earth!) The PyCon conference days will be March 11-13, preceded by
two tutorial days (March 9-10), and followed by four days of
development sprints (March 14-17).

PyCon 2011 is looking for proposals for the formal presentation tracks
(this includes "extreme talks"). A request for proposals for poster
sessions and tutorials will come separately.

Want to showcase your skills as a Python Hacker? Want to have hundreds
of people see your talk on the subject of your choice? Have some hot
button issue you think the community needs to address, or have
some package, code or project you simply love talking about? Want to
launch your master plan to take over the world with Python?

PyCon is your platform for getting the word out and teaching something
new to hundreds of people, face to face.

In the past, PyCon has had a broad range of presentations, from
reports on academic and commercial projects, tutorials on a broad
range of subjects, and case studies. All conference speakers are
volunteers and come from a myriad of backgrounds: some are new
speakers, some have been speaking for years. Everyone is welcome, so
bring your passion and your code! We've had some incredible past
PyCons, and we're looking to you to help us top them!

Online proposal submission is open now! Proposals  will be accepted
through November 10th, with acceptance notifications coming out by
January 20th. To get started, please see:

   <http://us.pycon.org/2011/speaker/>

For videos of talks from previous years - check out:

   <http://python.mirocommunity.org/category/conferences>

For more information on "Extreme Talks" see:

   <http://us.pycon.org/2011/speaker/extreme/>

We look forward to seeing you in Atlanta!

Please also note - registration for PyCon 2011 will also be capped at
a maximum of 1,500 delegates, including speakers. When registration
opens (soon), you're going to want to make sure you register early!
Speakers with accepted talks will have a guaranteed slot.

Important Dates:
   * November 1st, 2010: Talk proposals due.
   * December 15th, 2010: Acceptance emails sent.
   * January 19th, 2010: Early bird registration closes.
   * March 9-10th, 2011: Tutorial days at PyCon.
   * March 11-13th, 2011: PyCon main conference.
   * March 14-17th, 2011: PyCon sprints days.
