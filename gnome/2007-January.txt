FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Los Angeles, CA
January 2, 2007

The Southern California Linux Expo announces plans to a 'Women In
Open Source' Mini-conference. The goals of the conference are to
encourage women to use technology and open source and free software,
and to explore the obstacles that women face in breaking into the
technology industry.  The audience will be those women who may have
an interest in technology, but hesitate to get into it because they
believe it's a male-only club.  The conference will be held in
conjunction with the Fifth Annual So Cal Linux Expo, at the Westin
LAX Hotel.  The 'Women in Open Source' mini-conference will be held
February 9th.

If you are interested in speaking, there are still speaker slots
available. Contact Gareth Greenaway (gareth@socallinuxexpo.com) with
your talk proposal.
