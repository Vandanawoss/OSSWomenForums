Hi all,

Thanks to a confirmed sponsorship from Red Hat, GNOME is participating in Outreachy in the upcoming December round! Please consider adding your project idea and yourself as a mentor at https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/Outreachy/2017/DecemberMarch to help someone from an underrepresented background become a part of our community.

Because GNOME only usually has a few participants in Outreachy, we are looking to offer projects that are most strategic for GNOME. These include, but are not limited to, projects in the area of privacy, GTK+, core experience, core applications, developer experience, and development infrastructure.

Please add your ideas as soon as possible. The application period for Outreachy is already open and the application deadline is October 23.

You can help spread the word about Outreachy by using the flyer, tweet, or prepared e-mail text from https://www.outreachy.org/promote/

Thanks,
Marina

Hi Carlos,

In the previous rounds, GNOME Foundation preferred that the sponsorship is provided by some other organization, when possible, while also making the sponsorship available when necessary. This round, I was able to line up $6,500 in sponsorship towards one intern from Red Hat, which is sufficient for GNOME to participate in Outreachy. I am checking with other potential sponsors about whether they want to sponsor additional interns.

Thanks,
Marina

Hello Marina,

That sounds good!

Just a question, what is the sponsorship of Red Hat and how that
influences whether GNOME can participate in Outreachy? Couldn't we
sponsor the students from the GNOME foundation money?

Best
