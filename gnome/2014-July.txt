Hi,

We'll have the fifth annual women's dinner at GUADEC on Monday, July 28 at 6:30pm. If you would like to attend, please add your name at https://wiki.gnome.org/GUADEC/2014/WomensDinner so that we can find a restaurant and make a reservation that fits the group size. Please forward the information about the dinner along to women you meet at GUADEC who might not be on this list.

Thanks,
Marina
