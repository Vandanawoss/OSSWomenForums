Hi Ahu!

Sure, you can still get your application in! I would recommend focusing on =
connecting to a mentor of a project that doesn't have applicants (or can me=
ntor multiple participants) and putting in your application first. Then, yo=
u can work on your contribution in the few days past the application deadli=
ne. If you are a student, you should also apply for Google Summer of Code f=
or the same project, which also has a deadline tomorrow, but earlier in the=
 day.

What type of project and module are you interested in? If you are looking f=
or a coding project, as of recently "Automated WAI-ARIA testing using Accer=
ciser", "Epiphany A service to prevent phishing attacks", "Evolution: Add o=
ffline contact editing support to EDS=E2=80=99 Google Contacts backend", an=
d "Profile and optimize libfolks to accelerate Shell/Contacts/Empathy" from=
 https://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2012/Ideas did not have any applicants.=
 You can propose these ideas for the outreach internships too. Just get in =
touch with mentors for them to see which ones are unclaimed and start worki=
ng on the application. You can also select any project from https://live.gn=
ome.org/GnomeLove/Mentors and contact its mentor to see if there is anythin=
g you can propose to work on.

In addition to e-mailing people, you should join the relevant channels on I=
RC because that will speed up your communication with mentors. https://live=
.gnome.org/GnomeIrcChannels

Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
Marina

Hi Anna,

The timeline doesn't need to be very detailed for the Outreach Program for Women applications, because while we want the participants to have an idea about what they'll work on, we also want them to decide with the mentor about which tasks to take on as they go along, taking into account the priorities of the team and what tasks seem suitable. For Google Summer of Code, the timeline needs to be more detailed.

It is expected that a lot of testing will take place as you are working on the code and as your patch is being reviewed. You can mention that next to each task or as a general comment, if you like. You can also leave some time in the end of the summer to address any bugs related to the tasks you worked on.

Thanks,
Marina

Applications for AdaCamp DC are now open - apply now!

http://dc.adacamp.org/apply/

AdaCamp DC will be July 10=9611, 2012, in Washington DC, co-located
with Wikimania 2012. We are likely to have more applications than
available slots, so apply now to have the best chance of attending.
Applications close June 15 (May 11 for those requesting travel
assistance).

Who should apply

AdaCamp DC will bring together a wide variety of people from open
technology and culture, all of whom are working to support women in
open tech/culture. We're looking for people who:

* Participate in open technology and culture: any field involving
open/grassroots/community participation and sharing the results of
your work for free: open data, open source software, wikis, open
government, open libraries, remix/fan culture, open video, and more
* Can share information about women's experiences in that field,
including talking about women's achievements and the challenges they
face
* Want to work together and share strategies to support and promote
women in the field
* Share the Ada Initiative's feminist approach to supporting and
promoting women in open technology and culture
* Are young and old; students, professionals and hobbyists; from a
diverse range of backgrounds; and reflect the breadth of the open
technology and culture field

AdaCamp is open to people of all genders. However, since AdaCamp and
the Ada Initiative exist to support and promote women in open
technology and culture, prospective attendees who are not themselves
women will need to demonstrate a high level of prior engagement and
experience with the issues faced by women in those fields in order to
be invited.
