Hi Nicole,

I responded to your question on the gnome-love mailing list - https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-love/2013-April/msg00000.html

Thanks for saying hi here too :).

Hi Nicole, 

I was accepted and completed a GSoC project last summer with GNOME and I only knew Java when I applied. I have a friend who worked on Wine (working on code in C) with Google as his mentoring organization last summer, and he didn't know any C when he started. So it can be done! 

I would suggest that you contact the mentor for any project that interests you so you can start working on a patch. That will give you a sense of how to contribute.

Hi all, 

I'm currently a third year studying computer science student and am interested in working on a project for GSoC 2013 this summer. 
I mainly work in Java and know some C#, but I'm looking through the GNOME projects page and it seems like the primary language used is C. 
Would I still be able to contribute to a GNOME project with my current coding expertise? 

I posted a similar thread in the gnome-love mailing list, but I also wanted to introduce myself to this community. :) 

Thank you for all your help!

Hi!

Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers students stipends to =
write code for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects. Participants =
work remotely from home, while getting guidance from an assigned mentor and=
 collaborating within their project=E2=80=99s community. The application de=
adline for Google Summer of Code is May 3 and the program dates are June 17=
 to September 23. The stipend for the program is $5,000 (USD). The organiza=
tions that will participate in Google Summer of Code this year were announc=
ed on April 8. Starting to work with an organization as early as possible a=
nd making a few code contributions to the project you want to work on is es=
sential for a successful proposal.

http://code.google.com/soc

In an effort to get more women involved in FOSS, a number of organizations =
are offering Outreach Program for Women internships through a program organ=
ized by the GNOME Foundation. The internships have the same structure, the =
same stipend and similar program dates. The application deadline for the Ou=
treach Program for Women is May 1 and the program dates are June 17 to Sept=
ember 23. Unlike in Google Summer of Code, participants do not need to be s=
tudents and non-coding projects are available. In addition to coding, proje=
cts include such tasks as graphic design, documentation, bug triage and mar=
keting. To apply, you need to connect with an organization early and make a=
 few contributions relevant to the project you want to work on.

https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen

The mentorship opportunities are also available throughout the year for any=
one interested in getting started contributing to FOSS outside of the forma=
l internship program. In addition to the organizations participating in the=
 Outreach Program for Women, more organizations that offer informal mentors=
hip to all newcomers are listed here:

http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/wiki/Mentors

Please consider applying for Google Summer of Code or FOSS Outreach Program=
 for Women, encourage someone else to apply, or help spread the word by for=
warding this message to any interested university and community groups.

Thanks,
Marina

Hi!<br>
<br>
Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers students stipends to =
write code for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects. Participants =
work remotely from home, while getting guidance from an assigned mentor and=
 collaborating within their project?s community. The application deadline f=
or Google Summer of Code is May 3 and the program dates are June 17 to Sept=
ember 23. The stipend for the program is $5,000 (USD). The organizations th=
at will participate in Google Summer of Code this year were announced on Ap=
ril 8. Starting to work with an organization as early as possible and makin=
g a few code contributions to the project you want to work on is essential =
for a successful proposal.<br>

<br>
In an effort to get more women involved in FOSS, a number of organizations =
are offering Outreach Program for Women internships through a program organ=
ized by the GNOME Foundation. The internships have the same structure, the =
same stipend and similar program dates. The application deadline for the Ou=
treach Program for Women is May 1 and the program dates are June 17 to Sept=
ember 23. Unlike in Google Summer of Code, participants do not need to be s=
tudents and non-coding projects are available. In addition to coding, proje=
cts include such tasks as graphic design, documentation, bug triage and mar=
keting. To apply, you need to connect with an organization early and make a=
 few contributions relevant to the project you want to work on.<br>

<br>
The mentorship opportunities are also available throughout the year for any=
one interested in getting started contributing to FOSS outside of the forma=
l internship program. In addition to the organizations participating in the=
 Outreach Program for Women, more organizations that offer informal mentors=
hip to all newcomers are listed here:<br>

<br>
Please consider applying for Google Summer of Code or FOSS Outreach Program=
 for Women, encourage someone else to apply, or help spread the word by for=
warding this message to any interested university and community groups.<br>

Thanks,<br>
