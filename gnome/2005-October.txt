Hi guys,

I am going to attend the FOSS Road: http://www.tacticaltech.org/fossroad
(The central Asian camp on free and open source software)
I will host a BOF on women in open source communities. I've planned for
a brainstorming session and a sum up on some key issues like
limitations, problems, solutions, and future perspective. I have read
the essentials such as Val Hensen's
http://infohost.nmt.edu/~val/howto.html and now I am asking if anyone
here has any idea, or any experience to share.
Please do wish me luck ;)

Thank you,
fa

Hi Farzaneh,

Awesome! Great to hear that you're sparking more discussion of women in
FOSS communities; best of luck, and let us know how it goes!

I'm going to give ya a handful of links:

Linuxchix has a women in open source/free software bibliography you may
find helpful:
http://www.linuxchix.org/content/docs/research/bibliography

Also, I was recently pointed towards an interesting article Nancy
Ratliff, a Ph.D. candidate in Rhetoric & Feminism, had to say about
women in open source communities: http://culturecat.net/node/889 . You
might find something interesting in my response to the article:
http://www.livejournal.com/users/mihmo/6071.html

Hi GNOME Women,

As per a recent discussion LinuxChix's grrltalk and volunteer lists,
LinuxChix is considering what it can do to help the * Women projects,
including GNOME Women, out with their missions. So far we're doing two
things:

 1. updating our website to prominently link to the women development
    groups

 2. trying to actively liase with them to see if there's anything else
    they need or want from LinuxChix

Re #2, I volunteered to do liason with GNOME Women since I was here
anyway. So, let me know at any point if there seems to be some way that
GNOME Women and LinuxChix could work together or we could send you some
people or publicity or you could do the same for us or... let me know.

-Mary

Hi GNOME Women,

As per a recent discussion LinuxChix's grrltalk and volunteer lists,
LinuxChix is considering what it can do to help the * Women projects,
including GNOME Women, out with their missions. So far we're doing two
things:

 1. updating our website to prominently link to the women development
    groups

 2. trying to actively liase with them to see if there's anything else
    they need or want from LinuxChix

Re #2, I volunteered to do liason with GNOME Women since I was here
anyway. So, let me know at any point if there seems to be some way that
GNOME Women and LinuxChix could work together or we could send you some
people or publicity or you could do the same for us or... let me know.

-Mary

Hi guys,

I am going to attend the FOSS Road: http://www.tacticaltech.org/fossroad
(The central Asian camp on free and open source software)
I will host a BOF on women in open source communities. I've planned for
a brainstorming session and a sum up on some key issues like
limitations, problems, solutions, and future perspective. I have read
the essentials such as Val Hensen's
http://infohost.nmt.edu/~val/howto.html and now I am asking if anyone
here has any idea, or any experience to share.
Please do wish me luck ;)

Thank you,
fa

Hi Farzaneh,

Awesome! Great to hear that you're sparking more discussion of women in
FOSS communities; best of luck, and let us know how it goes!

I'm going to give ya a handful of links:

Linuxchix has a women in open source/free software bibliography you may
find helpful:
http://www.linuxchix.org/content/docs/research/bibliography

Also, I was recently pointed towards an interesting article Nancy
Ratliff, a Ph.D. candidate in Rhetoric & Feminism, had to say about
women in open source communities: http://culturecat.net/node/889 . You
might find something interesting in my response to the article:
http://www.livejournal.com/users/mihmo/6071.html

:)
