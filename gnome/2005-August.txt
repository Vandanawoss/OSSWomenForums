So here's my first stab at some content for our web page together:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomenWebPageDraft

It's frustrating how long it's taken to get everything set up. I think
the main issue is that we don't have enough recruits. It's hard to
actively recruit because we don't have a web site to point people at in
order to recruit, so not many people know about the project.

What is blocking the web site? Well, not having a logo. But no longer; I
think we should just get the content up, sans prettiness if we have to,
and we can always pretty it up later.

Which leads me to another topic - the logo contest results. Some logos
have received multiple votes from the same ip address, something I
enabled in the polling system because I knew a few people voting in the
poll were going to show up as having the same ip address from nat pools,
etc. This proved to be an unwise decision as some logos received as many
as 15 votes (40% of the total vote!) from the same IP address, and it's
unclear how to proceed. As Diana is the resident graphic designer, I'd
like leave the final decision in her hands, but I'm not sure how
everyone else feels about it.

Anyway, just an update from my front; my goal is to get a bare-bones web
site up by the end of this week and to then start sending emails out. It
would be nice to send announcements to university computer science
departments. Does this seem like a good plan? I can also talk to the
Marketing team and see if they'd be cool with a spot on the gnome.org
front page to point at the GNOME Women web site sometime in the future.

Do you want help with the site?

I'm OK in basic html/css.

I'm also happy to get a translation going for the site, so I could =20
translate text as it's created, if you like.

I think getting Gnome themselves, as well as the other womens' OSS =20
groups, to mention us, is a good idea. :)

I've seen one or two women translators on the gnome-i18n list whom =20
I'd like to invite here. It will be a lot easier when we have a =20
website to which we can point.

We also need to get some helpful information up there, and start some =20=

discussions here. Maybe an IRC channel, some quick tutes to help =20
people get started or solve common issues. These are all the things =20
that work for Debian-Women, so I'm keen to get them started here.

One thing that doesn't work for D-W is that it has become a far too =20
vehement site, where newbies and many women in general don't feel =20
comfortable posting. I would really like to see this group stay low-=20
key in that respect: yes, we can discuss technical issues and social =20
issues affecting us, but let's give people a bit of elbow-room, be =20
tolerant of mistakes and encourage new people.

My 5c for now (no 2c coins in Australia these days). :)

GNOME women has had an IRC channel for longer than it has had a mailing
list. It's #gnome-women on irc.gimp.net. That could use a mention on the
page.

Definitely. We need all the "getting-started" info up there, and any =20

I'm a good reference point myself, since I have trouble remembering =20
things. You can use me as an ongoing newbie. :D

Not to get too off-topic, but could you please avoid insulting DW on
random other lists? It'd be pretty classy of you to do that.

Erinn, I had no intention of insulting D-W at all. I simply said that =20=

there were some things that weren't working for it, and I can't be =20
the only person to have noticed that. I've kept on trying there, and =20
will continue to try there, but I'd really like to see it be easier =20
for new people, for example, in this group. I don't think that's a =20
bad thing.

I still love ASCII art...

I encountered a webpage the other day which had some basic =20

Oh, svashka, you've found the biggest problem in i18n. :(

Everybody has their own system, some groups can be parochial, and for =20=

most translators, it's a matter of trying to remember what to do in =20
which project, and not getting too confused!

Please have a look at the Translate Wiki for this:

http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/

and the link "Localization Guide", which has a lot of information =20
about different projects, including my info on the Translation =20
Project at the University of Montreal, a central project which =20
doesn't limit itself to specific distributions, so, like Pootle, has =20
great potential to break down some of the barriers in i18n. I would =20
encourage you very strongly to join the Translation Project. It's my =20
favourite i18n place. :)

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/HTML/index.html

I know the coordinator will be delighted to hear from you: I know her =20=

well, and would be happy to recommend you. I'm just looking to see =20
what Indic teams there are there...

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/registry.cgi?team=3Dindex

Hmm, there's a Hindi and a Punjabi team, but not Marathi or Sanskrit. =20=

You could start one. I'd be happy to help. :)

You can see my team page here:

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/registry.cgi?team=3Dvi

For Gnome, you can start here:

http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/

and please ask me any questions you like. Gnome is, in my experience, =20=

the best-organized individual project (after the general TP and =20
Pootle), and has some very supportive coordinators who are keen to =20
help. You can also pop up on the gnome-i18n list and ask about your =20
language(s).

I wish so much that we did all the i18n in one, integrated way (with =20
flexibility for input methods) for everyone, but that's not happening =20=

yet. :(

I get so confused sometimes, swapping from TP to Gnome to Debian to D-=20=

W to individual projects like BitTorrent or Psi... so I can help you =20
get confused too! :D

Start from the main pages I've listed, and ask questions! The main =20
sites have information both on joining an existing team, and on =20
forming a new team. You will find other translators very helpful: =20
you're not alone in this task, even if you're the only person in your =20=

team. Mostly, I've been the only Vietnamese translator world-wide :=20
( but I've always had support from and been able to share with other =20
translators. :)

So you meet the same translators on all the lists we have to join... ;)

I'm really impressed with how you've taken the risk to appear on new =20
lists, and ask questions which are not readily understood. Keep it =20
up! Let's hope more people, especially women, follow your example. :)

Hey, today when I was updating the gedit file, one edit was to =20
include "Marathi" language for the first time!

svashka, wave that flag!

Gnome has a really impressive array of translation teams and =20
languages. It's a testament to its vital translation program and keen =20=

workers. :)

My co-ordinator emailed me today, with a typo (which I'd fixed =20
<smugly>) and a pat on the back, which I think we all need, to keep =20
on going in what can be a very confusing and lonely area.

I think we should have a Pat on the Back Co-operative, for those =20
times when nobody seems to appreciate you! I hereby contribute my =20
Pat, and I hope we can build up a good store for those "You've =20

I'm not sure about the format: png?

This may not be a trivial task... :S

Well, one thing you fail to recognize is that there is a difficult
balance to maintain. (Highly) technical people involved are totally
underwhelmed by some technology and do not want to use it and in our
case, they tend to be the people in charge of how things get done; CVS
may be easy for committing purposes, but it also sucks. Highly technical
discussion may be off-putting to some newbies, but it's interesting to
non-newbies and *they* will leave if the level of discourse does not
match their experience. So, sure -- it's possible that DW has some of
these issues, but it's absolutely NOT specific to DW and had I known you
felt this was an issue, I would've patiently listened to your ideas for
improving it and seeing what could be done. Alas.

Either way, it would've been totally appropriate to bring this up on
DW's list, but the fact that you brought it up here instead -- without
any real desire for resolution -- is what makes it insulting.

There's very much two separate potential threads here.

Thread 1: how can GNOME Women maintain a balance between not scaring off
newer, less technical potential women contributors to GNOME and keeping
the interest of more technical contributors to the project (both women
and men)? Specific examples from the experience of other groups *may* be
useful here, *especially* where they have already found a solution. (I
can think of various examples from LinuxChix that people may find
useful.) But specific is much better than general, and positive better
than negative. "Debian Women/KDE Women/LinuxChix/GNOME in general are
really bad, let's do better" is risky territory. Each of those projects
has its own context and will choose its own balance.

I expect GNOME Women to be a pretty different place from LinuxChix, but
that's because LinuxChix is a support and social group for women Linux
users and GNOME Women is (I gather) a mentoring group for potential and
existing women GNOME developers, not because either of them sucks.

Thread 2: "Debian Women has got this wrong." (Quotes because I want to
make it clear it's not my opinion.) I agree with Erinn, Thread 2 is both
off-topic and potentially damaging here, move it to Debian Women.

, 2005-08-10 - 11:14 +1000-, Mary Gardiner :
hi all,

Was following this thread for a while and well flamefests are not really
a nice way to start off a new venture. So perhaps this thread can be
terminated right here.

The reason I joined gnome-women and linuxchix (tho not full-throttle
yet) is for the simple reason that i was the lonely-only girl in the
linux-user-group and l10n-team that i have been part of for the past 3
years. during these times i saw very different approaches being metted
out to ppl like newbies, techie-newbies, non-newbies, partial-interest-
groups(like me who are only interested in bits and pieces of the talk),
women-techies. More often than not a few of the all-rounders in the team
tend to overshadow the proceedings due to which seemingly "unimportant"
issues (which might be of huge importance for a new-linux-user) are left
unattended or distraughtly dealt with. this results in intimidating the
rest of the people in the group. Same happens with women in someplaces
where they are taken as non-serious or secondary players even after
showing immense skills. this makes women or for that matter any other
person conscious about  their level of  participation. this phenomenon
would perhaps vary in different parts of the globe. 

for me forums like gnome-women mean a place where i can air my views or
participate in the projects/proceedings and learn about the many nitty-
gritties that are often left unsaid or one is afraid to ask in a wider
forum, without inhibitions as i know i wouldnt be condemned as a second-
grade group member.

just my 2 ps

regards
Runa

I'm happy to do this: I've been trying to raise some of these issues =20
there for some time.

I would like to point out that I did not say "Debian Women has got =20
this wrong". I said there were some things that were working for D-W, =20=

and some things that weren't.

Is it possible for you to summarise these issues on this list as
positive suggestions for GNOME Women? For example, instead of saying
"D-W doesn't do X", you could simply suggest to us that "G-W should do X
because it would have Y benefits" without referring to D-W at all. (On
the other hand, if there's things that D-W does that you see as good,
praise them everywhere ;) )

Of course.

 =46rom talking to other women translators and developers, mostly new =20=

ones, who don't feel they have the confidence to take on "mainstream" =20=

groups, I think our group needs:

1. to be welcoming: make a point of welcoming new people, show an =20
interest in their background, invite them to share about what they do =20=

and what they want to achieve

Post: Welcome, X, to the Gnome Women list! It's great to see you =20
posting here for the first time. So you're working in Y? That must be =20=

interesting, bearing in mind the Z situation. We'd be interested to =20
hear what it's been like for you, as a woman in that field.

As for your question about AA, there are several options you could =20
usefully investigate... (etc.)


2. to be tolerant: we all make mistakes. If someone is unclear, makes =20=

a mistake or hasn't looked at the usual information, be polite and =20
helpful, give them good examples and encourage them to follow =20
effective models of practice

Example:

New poster: I dont knnow where find group to tryanslate (language X)

Response: Welcome to the Gnome-Women list! Gnome has a vibrant and =20
welcoming translation community. Please look at the main translation =20
project page (Y). I notice on the teams page (Z) that there isn't a =20
team for your language yet, but you can contact (ZZ) and ask about =20
forming a team. Please tell him/her you're a member of Gnome-Women, =20
and please keep asking questions here: we help each other. :)

as opposed to:

(link)

I'm happy to do that for translators, but I think it helps any new =20
enquirer, so perhaps other Gnome Women could volunteer to be focal =20
people for different Gnome areas.

New people don't _want_ to look silly or ignorant: most of the time =20
people are doing their best under the circumstances. Cut them some =20
slack.

Example:

Poster X advertizes her company on the group.

Response: We're really interested to hear about your company, but =20
this list isn't the place to advertize. Please have a look (here). =20
We'd really like to hear about what it's like for women workers at =20
your company: what has it been like for you?

This may all be obvious, but somehow it doesn't happen. :(

3. Read emails carefully. It sounds crazy to have to say that, but so =20=

often I've seen new posters put off by having their questions =20
ignored, and being confused and upset by suddenly receiving responses =20=

about something else. If we're not entirely sure what someone means, =20
we can ask polite questions:

Poster: I can't find gnomewomen page

Respone: Hi, X. Good to hear from you. Which Gnome Women page are you =20=

looking for? (Of course, they're all equally wonderful. ;) ) What =20
information are you looking for?

as opposed to:

(link)

These types of responses take more time, but I think it's worth doing =20=

one post like that, than sending in several that aren't welcoming and =20=

helpful.

Everyone has their own style, but welcoming and helpful should be =20
part of it in a group like this, IMHO.

4. Celebrate achievement.

Example:

Package X is gnomewomen member Y's first package. It's in testing.

Post: Our new Gnome Woman package maintainer, Y, has her first =20
package in testing now! It can be a long trail, but worth it in the =20
end. Keep all your non-keyboarding fingers crossed for this possibly =20
nervous package. (How would _you_ feel if you were in testing? ;) )

Y, how has it been getting your package to this stage? What have been =20=

the high points and low points, so far? I had awful problems with A, =20
but B was pretty easy, considering C. D helped me a lot with that.

Example:

Post: We want to hear what you're doing this month. Do you have =20
anything you really want to get out of the way in (month)? Let's put =20
up a page of current projects, and highlight milestones. In my case, =20
I want to get Y done. I need to start (here), and do (this) first, =20
but I think I can get (this) done by (then). My best resource is =20
(this), and in time management I focus on (that). How about you?

This is a way to help spread good models of practice, reinforce skills.

Post: Gnome Woman X popped up on our IRC channel for the first time =20
last night, Y time. Good to see you there! We had a very useful chat =20
about Z, in between bad jokes about AA. Is there anyone here who =20
would like to chat on the channel, but doesn't know where to begin? =20
We've got an IRC primer (here), but please ask questions on the list, =20=

too. We all had to start at the beginning once. ;)

etc.

5. Keep it cool.

Post: (non-welcoming, abrupt, not reading the original etc.)

Response: Z, I know you can help X with her question: (question =20
restated). We need to remember that different people have different =20
levels of expertise. Where do you think she should start in =20
addressing (question restated)?

Then the original poster isn't confused by wondering if she's =20
expressed herself properly, and can keep hoping to get some actual help.

Managing poster behaviour is _not_ easy, but if there are a core =20
group of Gnome Women consistently being welcoming and helpful, I =20
think the occasional less-accepting post will be bearable for new and =20=

less confident people. They're looking at the majority behaviour, and =20=

thinking, "Can I do this? Can I take the risk that Z will talk like =20
that to me? But X and Y are always helpful, I can ask, and at a pinch =20=

I might be able to email one of them. It feels like an accepting place."

6. Invite people to join the list. My i18n coordinator for Debian =20
invited me to join the D-W list, which I didn't even know existed, =20
and I really appreciated the invitation. Let's target one or two =20
invitations each month per Gnome Women, and see whom we find.

That's just a few ideas, anyway. I hope they are useful. :)

Thanks Clytie, this is a very neatly collated-list of the basic problems 
  that most of us face in countries where women are new to the 
tech-world and thats the reason we tend to yearn for forums where we are 
not made to look silly and can be comparitively comfortable. Same goes 
for newbies.

Forums like DW or GW  stretch beyond geographical boundaries and can 
perhaps help set the precedent for the other existing or new forums like 
regional lugs etc. :)

Hi Clytie,

Thanks for these suggestions. I hope both we and you can put them into
practice on the GNOME Women lists. (You get to be as "old hand" as any
of us, on such a new list ;) )

Thankyou for appreciating it. It's always hard to summarize such a =20
big topic. It really helps to hear what you say. :)

Oh, I hope so. I know a lot of the regional LUGs can be quite =20
unpleasant for us, really "men-only" areas where you get the worst =20
kind of reception. :(  Unfortunately, there are plenty of places =20
online which are the same. D-W and G-W have the opportunity to hold =20
out a hand of encouragement to all the women who are struggling to =20
improve their cultural situation through the tech. explosion. I =20
really want to see more Asian women here and on D-W. We can help each =20=

other so much. :)  (I want to see women from all areas and occupations!)

Thankyou very much for appreciating them. I also hope we can =20
encourage people here. I do like the idea of a new list making it =20
easier for people to take the plunge. ;)

Hi Elnaz,

Thanks for your contribution! It's cute, but we've discussed similar
logo ideas in the past [1] and decided that "making up" the GNOME foot
to be cutesy/girly would make it harder for us to be taken seriously
within the community.

The logo thing is pretty much up in the air right now though, so if you
have other ideas feel free to post them!

Hey Clytie, help would be really appreciated! The thing that I'm worried
most about is content; I feel like we definitely want to go into more
detail on each of the different ways people can contribute... you have
good knowledge of how the translation teams work so maybe you'd like to
write up a document talking about some of the issues involved in
translating and how to get started? Your reply to svaksha [1] is a good
start on content for it!

Basically I'd like to use the wiki as a space to draft text for the
website. I think it's better to have an actual website though because if
we just rely on the wiki, anybody can register an account and mess with
the content (I'm thinking of that crazy "death to women's rights" guy
who attacked Debian Women and Linuxchix.) 

Setting up a website on gnome.org is a little complicated but I'm going
to try to spend some time on that today.

When our content gets to that point, that would be great! :)

Awesome! Feel free to point them towards the wiki in the meantime!

Yep, some of the Debian-Women ones are really good too, so we'll
probably want to link to them as well. It would be good to come up with
a list of what topics are the most in need of tutorials.

Yes, the more people we have contributing, the wider our coverage of =20
important information.

Thankyou, that's a very helpful suggestion. I'm currently writing a =20
lot of personal email on basic translation practices, so getting it =20
up somewhere I could point people to would be a good use of time. I =20
could include links to the Translate Wiki, the Gnome translator pages =20=

etc.

A password works for the D-W wiki: do you want to protect ours with =20
one? We just mail the password privately, or over IRC, to anyone who =20
wants to help with the wiki.

It's a good draft vehicle, and even might simplify the process of =20
getting stuff up on the main site, by allowing contributors to create =20=

their stuff there, then have focus people who transfer it to the site.

Certainly a little complicated. :) I think it is with any big org: =20
I'm still having svn probs with debian.org, although I got ssh =20
through today, which was a big help. Gnome CVS was difficult, too, =20
but once I had it working, it's been a big time-saver.

1. Write content.
2. Translate it.

I'll do that. You really want to do these things when people are =20

I think our two groups supporting each other, linking together, etc. =20
is a really good idea. Translators certainly cross project =20
boundaries, and it's not as though Gnome were a different OS. There =20
must be a huge number of Debian users who also use Gnome, so we could =20=

work together on a lot of things, certainly refer people between the =20
two groups.

I am _not_ going to spend the whole day on email today. (I did say =20
that.)

Hi everybody :)

I know I must be missing something obvious, but I can't find the G-W =20
wiki, to put up the introductory article for new translators.

It's not linked from the main G-W page. It's not in our mailing list =20
footer, or headers. The link has not been quoted in any of the posts =20
since I joined (25/6/05). I searched our list archives under "link =20
wiki" and came up empty. I googled with several combinations of =20
Gnome, Women and wiki, and didn't find the link. [1]

Come out, come out, wherever you are! :D

It would be great to have the wiki link on the main G-W page, as I =20
notice the IRC list link already is. I think it might be a good idea =20
to have the main page link, and/or IRC and wiki links, in the list =20
footer, if that's not too much bulk. Just the main page link would =20
find both IRC and the wiki for the person looking, once they are both =20=

there.

So <cough of embarrassment>, would someone kindly direct me out of my =20=

witless wanderings, to the Gnome-Women Wiki? :)

I can draft the article anyway, but I do need somewhere to put it. ;)

The wiki is at http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen (I posted a link to
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomenWebPageDraft earlier. I moved that
content to http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen on Friday - sorry for
forgetting to send notice to the list!) 

All of http://live.gnome.org/ is a wiki - You can create a wiki account
by going to the user preferences page (the first, leftmost extremely
tiny icon picture of a piece of paper and pencil in the upper right -
terrible ui). This brings you to http://live.gnome.org/UserPreferences .
Fill out the form at the top of the UserPreferences page to get a wiki
account, click the "create profile" button (don't click "mail me my
account data" as I always end up clicking by accident...! :) ) Then, I
think you need to check your email to get your password, and fill out
that horribly confusing form again
(http://live.gnome.org/UserPreferences) this time clicking on the
"login" button.

> I can draft the article anyway, but I do need somewhere to put it. ;)

I look forward to seeing it! :)

p.s. I made a typo in the list address when I first sent this so

There is a link called UserPreferences, but the pencil and paper icon =20=

is for editing the current page. It is a terrible UI, I agree. The =20
wiki is evidently partly translated into my language, but there are =20
errors, and quite a bit untranslated. Do you know where I would go to =20=

work on the translation? I want to make it easier for other =20
Vietnamese women coming here.

Thankyou, I don't think I could have worked it out without your help! =20=

What a weird wiki setup. Which wiki is it? I think I saw a moinmoin =20
error message when I was searching: that's not a wiki I've personally =20=

translated, and I don't think I've used it yet. All learning time. :)

Boy, did it end up a _lot_ longer than I thought. At least, there =20
should be anchors in the wiki. I didn't realize how much I'd had to =20
learn at Gnome, which wasn't easy to find. I hope I've saved other =20
people the same blundering about. :)

Now to wikify the article...

Ugh, yeah my bad, there isn't even an icon for logging in. You just have
to be lucky enough to see the link to UserPreferences on the bottom of
the front page.

I created a new OpenQuestion on how to submit translations of the wiki
(see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeLiveWiki)- I'm going to ask around to
see if I can find this out for you, though.

Yep, after looking around a bit I verified it is moinmoin.

It looks really good - thorough, very encouraging, and I'm sure really
helpful for getting up and running in translation. You may want to break
it up into some subpages - It might be a little intimidating for
newcomers to see just how much they need to learn all at once o_O. 

I added a list of anchors to the article for you - the tag to do this
automagically is [[TableOfContents]]. :-)

Ok, so I asked jdub about this - basically, there isn't any built-in way
of adding translations to moinmoin wikis. He is actually looking into
developing such a feature himself. In the meantime, he suggested we use
wiki subpages for adding translations to pages in the wiki. The
"standard" we could use for naming the subpages is [language
code][language name] like so: ViVietnamese. Also, we should provide
links to the translation of each translated page on the bottom.

So, for example, on the bottom of http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen I
added a link to "GnomeWomen/ViVietnamese" - the "GnomeWomen/" is added
to the beginning rather than just using ViVietnamese. This allows the
creation of a ViVietnamese subpage underneath the main GnomeWomen page.

So anyway, Clytie, there is a page set up off of GnomeWomen (on the
bottom) so you could go ahead and start translating the GnomeWomen page.
What you should do is copy/paste the page content from an editing screen
(so you get the wiki formatting); then, wherever there are links to
other pages (for example, on GnomeWomen you added the page
GnomeWomenTrans) add a "/ViVietnamese" to the end, so you'd change
GnomeWomenTrans to GnomeWomenTrans/ViVietnamese in the Vietnamese
translation page (GnomeWomen/ViVietnamese).

Does this make sense? Let me know if you need any clarification! I think
it'll make sense if you take a look at GnomeWomen now.

Bug days are a great learning opportunity and a good way to begin
getting involved with GNOME. Let me know if you are interested...

Subject: [gnome-love] Bug day tomorrow! With our unique rockbugmaster!
To: bugsquad <gnome-bugsquad@gnome.org>, gnome-love@gnome.org,
gnome-list@gnome.org


Heya!

I know everyone was waiting for this mail. I know it. It's been one
month since the last bug day and it's hard to live without having your
weekly bug day. So it comes back. Tomorrow.

And you know what? The imposing, the surprising, the fantastic, the only
LUIS VILLA will be here. Yes. Luis Villa. The one who launched the GNOME
bug days. No, he's not that old ;-)

If you want to meet Luis Villa, join us. And maybe he'll talk with you.
In fact, I'm sure he'll talk with you: he'll be really happy that his
exam of tonight will be ended that he'll talk with everyone. And he will
even hug you as you join #bugs. If he doesn't, just ask him to do it.

You're now convinced you should come to this bug day, aren't you? But
you don't know where it happens and when? It's really easy:

+ irc.gnome.org #bugs is where all the good action will occur
+ Thursday, august 18th is the day you should mark on your
calendar
+ 1500GMT->0300GMT is the right time to join (but there should be people
before and after to help you)

And now, for the standard part of the announcement:

What is this thing you call 'bug day'?
======================================

Bug day is a day we get together on IRC, find bugs, and clean bugzilla
so that developers can get more work done by focusing on bugs that
matter instead of duplicates, unconfirmable bugs, and things that
they've already closed.

Who can help at a bug day?
==========================

Virtually anyone. Bug day can be for the very timid, the very quiet, or
the very persistent.

You do need:
* decent ability to read English
* a user-level knowledge of GNOME
* 30 or so minutes of the day (the first time, after that you can do it
in very small chunks.)

You don't need:
* any programming ability
* any prior experience with QA
* a deep understanding of GNOME.

On the other hand, if you do have programming ability, it's also a great
way to get involved- after a few bug days, you can figure out what needs
help in gnome quickly and apply your talents there.

What will we focus on?
======================

Focus this week will be on unconfirmed bugs - reading them, marking them
NEEDINFO if needed, confirming them if they are still in a newer
release, finding duplicates, etc. Easy and fun.

Where can I get more information?
=================================

Bug days have a wiki page now:
http://live.gnome.org/Bugsquad/BugDays

Hello everybody, and thankyou very much to M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn for her =

Thanks very much, M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn, for both efforts. :)  I'll keep an =
eye on =20
that question.

When I wanted to translate the D-W wiki interface, I went to the =20
pmwiki site [1] and asked about it. It turned out that they package =20
all the translated interfaces up in a i18n tarball, and people can =20
choose to install it or not. [2] There wasn't a translation for my =20
language, so I did one there (very welcoming and helpful community =20
and mailing list, very active and creative!), and it was immediately =20
packaged up into an updated i18n tarball. More, we had some UTF-8 =20
display problems with our existing wiki software, and they fixed that =20=

straight away! This has made me a keen pmwiki supporter. ;)

The VNOSS wiki uses wakkawiki (wikini?) [3], and the Translate Wiki =20
[4] uses dokuwiki, because it also handles UTF-8 well, and I really =20
find its interface the easiest to read, and to use. I'll try to find =20
out if moinmoin has a similar approach to translation ... but I =20
personally find its interface non-intuitive and hard to read, so I'm =20
having trouble feeling enthusiastic about it. I wonder how committed =20
the Gnome Live admins are to their wiki software... ;)

Thanks very much for the appreciation and feedback, M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn. I =
agree =20
about the subpages. I'm also asking the gnome-i18n list and the =20
Translate project at Sourceforge for some feedback, so I hope to fine-=20=

tune it a bit. Danilo will probably have a minor fit at having his =20
praises sung publically. :D

That was a happy surprise, when I went back to it yesterday! Thanks a =20=

lot! (I really prefer the dokuwiki TOC, it doesn't take up the middle =20=

of the page, but creates a sidebox in the top right-hand-corner.) And =20=

thanks for the tag. I really think the help pages could be improved. =20
Where did you find that one?

It's great to put in the effort and have support and help with it. =20
Thankyou. It encourages me very much. :)

As I understand it, MoinMoin is usually chosen because it is written in
the programming language Python. This has a few calls on people: there
are a lot of people who like Python, and Python (among others) is seen
as more secure than PHP, which many wikis are written in.

I actually really dislike MoinMoin as a user (I don't know about it as
an administrator or developer). I much prefer MediaWiki (which is in
PHP), the wiki software used for Wikipedia et al, which has a saner
markup, fewer i18n bugs, a more open development community and a few
other things.

However, it unfortunately tends to be pretty hard to switch an active
wiki to new software. Most wikis use their own custom varient version of
wiki markup (MoinMoin and MediaWiki markup is pretty different), and
store their data in incompatible formats. You are therefore locked into
your choice of wiki to some extent. I don't know how long the GNOME Live
one has been around... probably long enough to have this effect.

Yes, that's definitely my first priority. Then I have somewhere to =20

include meta tags for search engines?

Yes, that's how I've done it elswhere. It saves a lot of messing =20
around, and avoids inconsistencies between original and translated =20
pages.

We're also going to need a Translation in Progress page (as in the D-=20
W wiki), including this information, and keeping track of who is =20
translating what, contact people etc., once this gets going. I'd be =20
happy to do that, and to keep track of all translators and translations.

That's actually much simpler than other structures I've used. =20
Thankyou. :)  Trying to use WikiLinks with UTF-8 doesn't work in any =20

Perfect sense. Thankyou. I've got somewhere to start. :)

A giggle moment: my fourteen-yr-old, who has had cancer, is still ill =20=

at home, and studying by distance learning: today, during their =20
teleconference lesson, they lost their teacher! The operator was =20
searching for her, the kids were wondering what was going on, and all =20=

in all it was a fun moment. Me being a pest, when Trinh said, "We've =20
lost our teacher, what do we do?" I answered, "Where did you put her =20
last?" and broke up.

I visualize this hanging telephone receiver, swinging quietly in the =20
breeze, and a big question mark over it. :D

I have taught a lot by distance learning (mostly the very early =20
computer-network efforts, with live simultaneous participation, well =20
before the Net), and there was always the fun of wondering what was =20
going to go wrong next. :D  I think it relaxed the students: they =20
were always keen to participate!

Now, to, uh, whatever it was I was doing...

Yes, I'm sure you're right. A bit like an unsatisfactory partner: you =20=

have to decide whether the hassle of having them around is worse than =20=

the hassle of getting rid of them. :D

One of the things I dislike most about the varying wikis is the =20
similarity but small difference between markup. You really need to =20
learn each one separately, and have the key next to you, so you =20
remember, no, this isn't the wiki that uses double square brackets =20
for links, this one only uses single square brackets, but double for =20
footnotes, where wiki 3 uses one round bracket for footnotes... etc. =20
They're not different enough to stick in your mind (at least, not in =20
mine when I use several different wikis from time to time), but =20
they're different enough not to work!

I agree with you that MediaWiki is a good one, I forgot that one when =20=

discussing wikis. Its layout and display are definitely superior!

:)  Marcelo is _quick_! I hope he's on the Gnome translating team. :D

Mine is up:

http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen_2fViVietnamese

I had to go into more detail, because many women in my community are =20
only just starting out with computers, if that, and may not know what =20=

a mailing list was, let alone IRC. So I gave more instructions, and =20
also said they could contact me if they were having problems joining =20
either.

I did some pages in Vietnamese, before, for the D-W wiki, and I =20
received an email yesterday that is fairly typical: a lady who'd =20
found the pages by searching for something to help Vietnamese women. =20
She needed help setting up her browser to view our language. She =20
thought the whole of D-W _was_ those pages in our language, and was =20
very excited that someone cared enough to do that, and was (this is =20
hard to translate, more culturally than linguistically) important =20
enough to do it, that women helping other women had enough status to =20
appear online.

So we may get low-level entrants, but I'm happy to support them. Just =20=

getting people online and functioning is such a big step in empowerment.

Hope you like the page. I think it looks dreadful, but that's more =20
moinmoin than my text, I hope. :)

Time to run a keen eye down the translation status pages for my =20
language. We're in string freeze, preparatory to release, and you =20
have to watch those developers _very_ carefully... :D  (some of them =20
keep modified strings in their hip pockets, just waiting for  a =20
translator to nod off so they can sneak them into the file. Hmm, I'm =20
starting to suffer from a highly-specialized type of paranoia here...)

Hi guys,

For those of you who may be lurking and want to contribute, but are not
sure how - this seems to be a pretty straightforward project to help
GNOME that doesn't involve any special technical skills but requires
good writing skills. If any of you are talented writers, please consider
this project!

Hi guys,

Over the weekend, Luchezar Petkov (Slash / Manowarrior in the IRC
channel) has contributed a Bulgarian translation of the wiki page:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen_2fBgBulgarian Thanks Luchezar! :)

insane, I do not know).

I've been translating the Gnome 2.12 release notes today, which =20
included ploughing through a l-o-n-g list of people who were being =20
thanked individually for their special contributions, things that had =20=

made so much difference, they deserved this moment of fame.

One woman. One. :(

I don't know her personally, but thankyou, Irene Ryan, for giving the =20=

rest of us hope of becoming visible.

Is this simply a sign that there are far too few women involved in =20
Gnome, and in free software generally, or is it something else? In =20
either case, I hope we can change this situation.

Back to the release notes...

So here's my first stab at some content for our web page together:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomenWebPageDraft

It's frustrating how long it's taken to get everything set up. I think
the main issue is that we don't have enough recruits. It's hard to
actively recruit because we don't have a web site to point people at in
order to recruit, so not many people know about the project.

What is blocking the web site? Well, not having a logo. But no longer; I
think we should just get the content up, sans prettiness if we have to,
and we can always pretty it up later.

Which leads me to another topic - the logo contest results. Some logos
have received multiple votes from the same ip address, something I
enabled in the polling system because I knew a few people voting in the
poll were going to show up as having the same ip address from nat pools,
etc. This proved to be an unwise decision as some logos received as many
as 15 votes (40% of the total vote!) from the same IP address, and it's
unclear how to proceed. As Diana is the resident graphic designer, I'd
like leave the final decision in her hands, but I'm not sure how
everyone else feels about it.

Anyway, just an update from my front; my goal is to get a bare-bones web
site up by the end of this week and to then start sending emails out. It
would be nice to send announcements to university computer science
departments. Does this seem like a good plan? I can also talk to the
Marketing team and see if they'd be cool with a spot on the gnome.org
front page to point at the GNOME Women web site sometime in the future.

Do you want help with the site?

I'm OK in basic html/css.

I'm also happy to get a translation going for the site, so I could =20
translate text as it's created, if you like.

I think getting Gnome themselves, as well as the other womens' OSS =20
groups, to mention us, is a good idea. :)

I've seen one or two women translators on the gnome-i18n list whom =20
I'd like to invite here. It will be a lot easier when we have a =20
website to which we can point.

We also need to get some helpful information up there, and start some =20=

discussions here. Maybe an IRC channel, some quick tutes to help =20
people get started or solve common issues. These are all the things =20
that work for Debian-Women, so I'm keen to get them started here.

One thing that doesn't work for D-W is that it has become a far too =20
vehement site, where newbies and many women in general don't feel =20
comfortable posting. I would really like to see this group stay low-=20
key in that respect: yes, we can discuss technical issues and social =20
issues affecting us, but let's give people a bit of elbow-room, be =20
tolerant of mistakes and encourage new people.

My 5c for now (no 2c coins in Australia these days). :)

GNOME women has had an IRC channel for longer than it has had a mailing
list. It's #gnome-women on irc.gimp.net. That could use a mention on the
page.

Definitely. We need all the "getting-started" info up there, and any =20
references. :)

Erinn, I had no intention of insulting D-W at all. I simply said that =20=

there were some things that weren't working for it, and I can't be =20
the only person to have noticed that. I've kept on trying there, and =20
will continue to try there, but I'd really like to see it be easier =20
for new people, for example, in this group. I don't think that's a =20
bad thing.

I still love ASCII art...

I encountered a webpage the other day which had some basic =20
information on it, but took ages to load, since _everything_ on the =20

Oh, svashka, you've found the biggest problem in i18n. :(

Everybody has their own system, some groups can be parochial, and for =20=

most translators, it's a matter of trying to remember what to do in =20
which project, and not getting too confused!

Please have a look at the Translate Wiki for this:

http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/

and the link "Localization Guide", which has a lot of information =20
about different projects, including my info on the Translation =20
Project at the University of Montreal, a central project which =20
doesn't limit itself to specific distributions, so, like Pootle, has =20
great potential to break down some of the barriers in i18n. I would =20
encourage you very strongly to join the Translation Project. It's my =20
favourite i18n place. :)

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/HTML/index.html

I know the coordinator will be delighted to hear from you: I know her =20=

well, and would be happy to recommend you. I'm just looking to see =20
what Indic teams there are there...

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/registry.cgi?team=3Dindex

Hmm, there's a Hindi and a Punjabi team, but not Marathi or Sanskrit. =20=

You could start one. I'd be happy to help. :)

You can see my team page here:

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/registry.cgi?team=3Dvi

For Gnome, you can start here:

http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/

and please ask me any questions you like. Gnome is, in my experience, =20=

the best-organized individual project (after the general TP and =20
Pootle), and has some very supportive coordinators who are keen to =20
help. You can also pop up on the gnome-i18n list and ask about your =20
language(s).

I wish so much that we did all the i18n in one, integrated way (with =20
flexibility for input methods) for everyone, but that's not happening =20=

yet. :(

I get so confused sometimes, swapping from TP to Gnome to Debian to D-=20=

W to individual projects like BitTorrent or Psi... so I can help you =20
get confused too! :D

Start from the main pages I've listed, and ask questions! The main =20
sites have information both on joining an existing team, and on =20
forming a new team. You will find other translators very helpful: =20
you're not alone in this task, even if you're the only person in your =20=

team. Mostly, I've been the only Vietnamese translator world-wide :=20
( but I've always had support from and been able to share with other =20
translators. :)

So you meet the same translators on all the lists we have to join... ;)

I'm really impressed with how you've taken the risk to appear on new =20
lists, and ask questions which are not readily understood. Keep it =20
up! Let's hope more people, especially women, follow your example. :)

Hey, today when I was updating the gedit file, one edit was to =20
include "Marathi" language for the first time!

svashka, wave that flag!

Gnome has a really impressive array of translation teams and =20
languages. It's a testament to its vital translation program and keen =20=

workers. :)

My co-ordinator emailed me today, with a typo (which I'd fixed =20
<smugly>) and a pat on the back, which I think we all need, to keep =20
on going in what can be a very confusing and lonely area.

I think we should have a Pat on the Back Co-operative, for those =20
times when nobody seems to appreciate you! I hereby contribute my =20
Pat, and I hope we can build up a good store for those "You've =20
changed the strings AGAIN??!!" moments.

I'm not sure about the format: png?

<tries to compress a pat on the back>

Hey! Come back here!

This may not be a trivial task... :S

Well, one thing you fail to recognize is that there is a difficult
balance to maintain. (Highly) technical people involved are totally
underwhelmed by some technology and do not want to use it and in our
case, they tend to be the people in charge of how things get done; CVS
may be easy for committing purposes, but it also sucks. Highly technical
discussion may be off-putting to some newbies, but it's interesting to
non-newbies and *they* will leave if the level of discourse does not
match their experience. So, sure -- it's possible that DW has some of
these issues, but it's absolutely NOT specific to DW and had I known you
felt this was an issue, I would've patiently listened to your ideas for
improving it and seeing what could be done. Alas.

Either way, it would've been totally appropriate to bring this up on
DW's list, but the fact that you brought it up here instead -- without
any real desire for resolution -- is what makes it insulting.

There's very much two separate potential threads here.

Thread 1: how can GNOME Women maintain a balance between not scaring off
newer, less technical potential women contributors to GNOME and keeping
the interest of more technical contributors to the project (both women
and men)? Specific examples from the experience of other groups *may* be
useful here, *especially* where they have already found a solution. (I
can think of various examples from LinuxChix that people may find
useful.) But specific is much better than general, and positive better
than negative. "Debian Women/KDE Women/LinuxChix/GNOME in general are
really bad, let's do better" is risky territory. Each of those projects
has its own context and will choose its own balance.

I expect GNOME Women to be a pretty different place from LinuxChix, but
that's because LinuxChix is a support and social group for women Linux
users and GNOME Women is (I gather) a mentoring group for potential and
existing women GNOME developers, not because either of them sucks.

Thread 2: "Debian Women has got this wrong." (Quotes because I want to
make it clear it's not my opinion.) I agree with Erinn, Thread 2 is both
off-topic and potentially damaging here, move it to Debian Women.

hi all,

Was following this thread for a while and well flamefests are not really
a nice way to start off a new venture. So perhaps this thread can be
terminated right here.

The reason I joined gnome-women and linuxchix (tho not full-throttle
yet) is for the simple reason that i was the lonely-only girl in the
linux-user-group and l10n-team that i have been part of for the past 3
years. during these times i saw very different approaches being metted
out to ppl like newbies, techie-newbies, non-newbies, partial-interest-
groups(like me who are only interested in bits and pieces of the talk),
women-techies. More often than not a few of the all-rounders in the team
tend to overshadow the proceedings due to which seemingly "unimportant"
issues (which might be of huge importance for a new-linux-user) are left
unattended or distraughtly dealt with. this results in intimidating the
rest of the people in the group. Same happens with women in someplaces
where they are taken as non-serious or secondary players even after
showing immense skills. this makes women or for that matter any other
person conscious about  their level of  participation. this phenomenon
would perhaps vary in different parts of the globe. 

for me forums like gnome-women mean a place where i can air my views or
participate in the projects/proceedings and learn about the many nitty-
gritties that are often left unsaid or one is afraid to ask in a wider
forum, without inhibitions as i know i wouldnt be condemned as a second-
grade group member.

just my 2 ps

regards
Runa

I'm happy to do this: I've been trying to raise some of these issues =20
there for some time.

I would like to point out that I did not say "Debian Women has got =20
this wrong". I said there were some things that were working for D-W, =20=

and some things that weren't.

Is it possible for you to summarise these issues on this list as
positive suggestions for GNOME Women? For example, instead of saying
"D-W doesn't do X", you could simply suggest to us that "G-W should do X
because it would have Y benefits" without referring to D-W at all. (On
the other hand, if there's things that D-W does that you see as good,
praise them everywhere ;) )

Of course.

 =46rom talking to other women translators and developers, mostly new =20=

ones, who don't feel they have the confidence to take on "mainstream" =20=

groups, I think our group needs:

1. to be welcoming: make a point of welcoming new people, show an =20
interest in their background, invite them to share about what they do =20=

and what they want to achieve

Post: Welcome, X, to the Gnome Women list! It's great to see you =20
posting here for the first time. So you're working in Y? That must be =20=

interesting, bearing in mind the Z situation. We'd be interested to =20
hear what it's been like for you, as a woman in that field.

As for your question about AA, there are several options you could =20
usefully investigate... (etc.)


2. to be tolerant: we all make mistakes. If someone is unclear, makes =20=

a mistake or hasn't looked at the usual information, be polite and =20
helpful, give them good examples and encourage them to follow =20
effective models of practice

Example:

New poster: I dont knnow where find group to tryanslate (language X)

Response: Welcome to the Gnome-Women list! Gnome has a vibrant and =20
welcoming translation community. Please look at the main translation =20
project page (Y). I notice on the teams page (Z) that there isn't a =20
team for your language yet, but you can contact (ZZ) and ask about =20
forming a team. Please tell him/her you're a member of Gnome-Women, =20
and please keep asking questions here: we help each other. :)

as opposed to:

(link)

I'm happy to do that for translators, but I think it helps any new =20
enquirer, so perhaps other Gnome Women could volunteer to be focal =20
people for different Gnome areas.

New people don't _want_ to look silly or ignorant: most of the time =20
people are doing their best under the circumstances. Cut them some =20
slack.

Example:

Poster X advertizes her company on the group.

Response: We're really interested to hear about your company, but =20
this list isn't the place to advertize. Please have a look (here). =20
We'd really like to hear about what it's like for women workers at =20
your company: what has it been like for you?

This may all be obvious, but somehow it doesn't happen. :(

3. Read emails carefully. It sounds crazy to have to say that, but so =20=

often I've seen new posters put off by having their questions =20
ignored, and being confused and upset by suddenly receiving responses =20=

about something else. If we're not entirely sure what someone means, =20
we can ask polite questions:

Poster: I can't find gnomewomen page

Respone: Hi, X. Good to hear from you. Which Gnome Women page are you =20=

looking for? (Of course, they're all equally wonderful. ;) ) What =20
information are you looking for?

as opposed to:

(link)

These types of responses take more time, but I think it's worth doing =20=

one post like that, than sending in several that aren't welcoming and =20=

helpful.

Everyone has their own style, but welcoming and helpful should be =20
part of it in a group like this, IMHO.

4. Celebrate achievement.

Example:

Package X is gnomewomen member Y's first package. It's in testing.

Post: Our new Gnome Woman package maintainer, Y, has her first =20
package in testing now! It can be a long trail, but worth it in the =20
end. Keep all your non-keyboarding fingers crossed for this possibly =20
nervous package. (How would _you_ feel if you were in testing? ;) )

Y, how has it been getting your package to this stage? What have been =20=

the high points and low points, so far? I had awful problems with A, =20
but B was pretty easy, considering C. D helped me a lot with that.

Example:

Post: We want to hear what you're doing this month. Do you have =20
anything you really want to get out of the way in (month)? Let's put =20
up a page of current projects, and highlight milestones. In my case, =20
I want to get Y done. I need to start (here), and do (this) first, =20
but I think I can get (this) done by (then). My best resource is =20
(this), and in time management I focus on (that). How about you?

This is a way to help spread good models of practice, reinforce skills.

Post: Gnome Woman X popped up on our IRC channel for the first time =20
last night, Y time. Good to see you there! We had a very useful chat =20
about Z, in between bad jokes about AA. Is there anyone here who =20
would like to chat on the channel, but doesn't know where to begin? =20
We've got an IRC primer (here), but please ask questions on the list, =20=

too. We all had to start at the beginning once. ;)

etc.

5. Keep it cool.

Post: (non-welcoming, abrupt, not reading the original etc.)

Response: Z, I know you can help X with her question: (question =20
restated). We need to remember that different people have different =20
levels of expertise. Where do you think she should start in =20
addressing (question restated)?

Then the original poster isn't confused by wondering if she's =20
expressed herself properly, and can keep hoping to get some actual help.

Managing poster behaviour is _not_ easy, but if there are a core =20
group of Gnome Women consistently being welcoming and helpful, I =20
think the occasional less-accepting post will be bearable for new and =20=

less confident people. They're looking at the majority behaviour, and =20=

thinking, "Can I do this? Can I take the risk that Z will talk like =20
that to me? But X and Y are always helpful, I can ask, and at a pinch =20=

I might be able to email one of them. It feels like an accepting place."

6. Invite people to join the list. My i18n coordinator for Debian =20
invited me to join the D-W list, which I didn't even know existed, =20
and I really appreciated the invitation. Let's target one or two =20
invitations each month per Gnome Women, and see whom we find.

That's just a few ideas, anyway. I hope they are useful. :)

Thanks Clytie, this is a very neatly collated-list of the basic problems 
  that most of us face in countries where women are new to the 
tech-world and thats the reason we tend to yearn for forums where we are 
not made to look silly and can be comparitively comfortable. Same goes 
for newbies.

Forums like DW or GW  stretch beyond geographical boundaries and can 
perhaps help set the precedent for the other existing or new forums like 
regional lugs etc. :)

Hi Clytie,

Thanks for these suggestions. I hope both we and you can put them into
practice on the GNOME Women lists. (You get to be as "old hand" as any
of us, on such a new list ;) )

Thankyou for appreciating it. It's always hard to summarize such a =20

Oh, I hope so. I know a lot of the regional LUGs can be quite =20

online which are the same. D-W and G-W have the opportunity to hold =20

other so much. :)  (I want to see women from all areas and occupations!)

Thankyou very much for appreciating them. I also hope we can =20
encourage people here. I do like the idea of a new list making it =20
easier for people to take the plunge. ;)

Hi Elnaz,

Thanks for your contribution! It's cute, but we've discussed similar
logo ideas in the past [1] and decided that "making up" the GNOME foot
to be cutesy/girly would make it harder for us to be taken seriously
within the community.

The logo thing is pretty much up in the air right now though, so if you
have other ideas feel free to post them!

Hey Clytie, help would be really appreciated! The thing that I'm worried
most about is content; I feel like we definitely want to go into more
detail on each of the different ways people can contribute... you have
good knowledge of how the translation teams work so maybe you'd like to
write up a document talking about some of the issues involved in
translating and how to get started? Your reply to svaksha [1] is a good
start on content for it!

Basically I'd like to use the wiki as a space to draft text for the
website. I think it's better to have an actual website though because if
we just rely on the wiki, anybody can register an account and mess with
the content (I'm thinking of that crazy "death to women's rights" guy
who attacked Debian Women and Linuxchix.) 

Setting up a website on gnome.org is a little complicated but I'm going
to try to spend some time on that today.

When our content gets to that point, that would be great! :)

Awesome! Feel free to point them towards the wiki in the meantime!

Yep, some of the Debian-Women ones are really good too, so we'll
probably want to link to them as well. It would be good to come up with
a list of what topics are the most in need of tutorials.

Yes, the more people we have contributing, the wider our coverage of =20

Thankyou, that's a very helpful suggestion. I'm currently writing a =20
lot of personal email on basic translation practices, so getting it =20
up somewhere I could point people to would be a good use of time. I =20
could include links to the Translate Wiki, the Gnome translator pages =20=

etc.

A password works for the D-W wiki: do you want to protect ours with =20
one? We just mail the password privately, or over IRC, to anyone who =20
wants to help with the wiki.

It's a good draft vehicle, and even might simplify the process of =20
getting stuff up on the main site, by allowing contributors to create =20=

their stuff there, then have focus people who transfer it to the site.

Certainly a little complicated. :) I think it is with any big org: =20
I'm still having svn probs with debian.org, although I got ssh =20
through today, which was a big help. Gnome CVS was difficult, too, =20
but once I had it working, it's been a big time-saver.

1. Write content.
2. Translate it.

I'll do that. You really want to do these things when people are =20
ready, or show an interest. That's where having stuff online is such =20
a great resource.

I think our two groups supporting each other, linking together, etc. =20
is a really good idea. Translators certainly cross project =20
boundaries, and it's not as though Gnome were a different OS. There =20
must be a huge number of Debian users who also use Gnome, so we could =20=

work together on a lot of things, certainly refer people between the =20
two groups.

I am _not_ going to spend the whole day on email today. (I did say =20
that.)

Hi everybody :)

I know I must be missing something obvious, but I can't find the G-W =20
wiki, to put up the introductory article for new translators.

It's not linked from the main G-W page. It's not in our mailing list =20
footer, or headers. The link has not been quoted in any of the posts =20
since I joined (25/6/05). I searched our list archives under "link =20
wiki" and came up empty. I googled with several combinations of =20
Gnome, Women and wiki, and didn't find the link. [1]

Come out, come out, wherever you are! :D

It would be great to have the wiki link on the main G-W page, as I =20
notice the IRC list link already is. I think it might be a good idea =20
to have the main page link, and/or IRC and wiki links, in the list =20
footer, if that's not too much bulk. Just the main page link would =20
find both IRC and the wiki for the person looking, once they are both =20=

there.

So <cough of embarrassment>, would someone kindly direct me out of my =20=

witless wanderings, to the Gnome-Women Wiki? :)

I can draft the article anyway, but I do need somewhere to put it. ;)

The wiki is at http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen (I posted a link to
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomenWebPageDraft earlier. I moved that
content to http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen on Friday - sorry for
forgetting to send notice to the list!) 

All of http://live.gnome.org/ is a wiki - You can create a wiki account
by going to the user preferences page (the first, leftmost extremely
tiny icon picture of a piece of paper and pencil in the upper right -
terrible ui). This brings you to http://live.gnome.org/UserPreferences .
Fill out the form at the top of the UserPreferences page to get a wiki
account, click the "create profile" button (don't click "mail me my
account data" as I always end up clicking by accident...! :) ) Then, I
think you need to check your email to get your password, and fill out
that horribly confusing form again
(http://live.gnome.org/UserPreferences) this time clicking on the
"login" button.

I look forward to seeing it! :)

p.s. I made a typo in the list address when I first sent this so

There is a link called UserPreferences, but the pencil and paper icon =20=

is for editing the current page. It is a terrible UI, I agree. The =20
wiki is evidently partly translated into my language, but there are =20
errors, and quite a bit untranslated. Do you know where I would go to =20=

work on the translation? I want to make it easier for other =20
Vietnamese women coming here.

Thankyou, I don't think I could have worked it out without your help! =20=

What a weird wiki setup. Which wiki is it? I think I saw a moinmoin =20
error message when I was searching: that's not a wiki I've personally =20=

translated, and I don't think I've used it yet. All learning time. :)

Boy, did it end up a _lot_ longer than I thought. At least, there =20
should be anchors in the wiki. I didn't realize how much I'd had to =20
learn at Gnome, which wasn't easy to find. I hope I've saved other =20
people the same blundering about. :)

Now to wikify the article...

Ugh, yeah my bad, there isn't even an icon for logging in. You just have
to be lucky enough to see the link to UserPreferences on the bottom of
the front page.

I created a new OpenQuestion on how to submit translations of the wiki
(see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeLiveWiki)- I'm going to ask around to
see if I can find this out for you, though.

Yep, after looking around a bit I verified it is moinmoin.

It looks really good - thorough, very encouraging, and I'm sure really
helpful for getting up and running in translation. You may want to break
it up into some subpages - It might be a little intimidating for
newcomers to see just how much they need to learn all at once o_O. 

I added a list of anchors to the article for you - the tag to do this
automagically is [[TableOfContents]]. :-)

Ok, so I asked jdub about this - basically, there isn't any built-in way
of adding translations to moinmoin wikis. He is actually looking into
developing such a feature himself. In the meantime, he suggested we use
wiki subpages for adding translations to pages in the wiki. The
"standard" we could use for naming the subpages is [language
code][language name] like so: ViVietnamese. Also, we should provide
links to the translation of each translated page on the bottom.

So, for example, on the bottom of http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen I
added a link to "GnomeWomen/ViVietnamese" - the "GnomeWomen/" is added
to the beginning rather than just using ViVietnamese. This allows the
creation of a ViVietnamese subpage underneath the main GnomeWomen page.

So anyway, Clytie, there is a page set up off of GnomeWomen (on the
bottom) so you could go ahead and start translating the GnomeWomen page.
What you should do is copy/paste the page content from an editing screen
(so you get the wiki formatting); then, wherever there are links to
other pages (for example, on GnomeWomen you added the page
GnomeWomenTrans) add a "/ViVietnamese" to the end, so you'd change
GnomeWomenTrans to GnomeWomenTrans/ViVietnamese in the Vietnamese
translation page (GnomeWomen/ViVietnamese).

Does this make sense? Let me know if you need any clarification! I think
it'll make sense if you take a look at GnomeWomen now.

Bug days are a great learning opportunity and a good way to begin
getting involved with GNOME. Let me know if you are interested...

To: bugsquad <gnome-bugsquad@gnome.org>, gnome-love@gnome.org,
gnome-list@gnome.org


Heya!

I know everyone was waiting for this mail. I know it. It's been one
month since the last bug day and it's hard to live without having your
weekly bug day. So it comes back. Tomorrow.

And you know what? The imposing, the surprising, the fantastic, the only
LUIS VILLA will be here. Yes. Luis Villa. The one who launched the GNOME
bug days. No, he's not that old ;-)

If you want to meet Luis Villa, join us. And maybe he'll talk with you.
In fact, I'm sure he'll talk with you: he'll be really happy that his
exam of tonight will be ended that he'll talk with everyone. And he will
even hug you as you join #bugs. If he doesn't, just ask him to do it.

You're now convinced you should come to this bug day, aren't you? But
you don't know where it happens and when? It's really easy:

+ irc.gnome.org #bugs is where all the good action will occur
+ Thursday, august 18th is the day you should mark on your
calendar
+ 1500GMT->0300GMT is the right time to join (but there should be people
before and after to help you)

And now, for the standard part of the announcement:

What is this thing you call 'bug day'?
======================================

Bug day is a day we get together on IRC, find bugs, and clean bugzilla
so that developers can get more work done by focusing on bugs that
matter instead of duplicates, unconfirmable bugs, and things that
they've already closed.

Who can help at a bug day?
==========================

Virtually anyone. Bug day can be for the very timid, the very quiet, or
the very persistent.

You do need:
* decent ability to read English
* a user-level knowledge of GNOME
* 30 or so minutes of the day (the first time, after that you can do it
in very small chunks.)

You don't need:
* any programming ability
* any prior experience with QA
* a deep understanding of GNOME.

On the other hand, if you do have programming ability, it's also a great
way to get involved- after a few bug days, you can figure out what needs
help in gnome quickly and apply your talents there.

What will we focus on?
======================

Focus this week will be on unconfirmed bugs - reading them, marking them
NEEDINFO if needed, confirming them if they are still in a newer
release, finding duplicates, etc. Easy and fun.

Where can I get more information?
=================================

Bug days have a wiki page now:
http://live.gnome.org/Bugsquad/BugDays

Thanks very much, M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn, for both efforts. :)  I'll keep an =
eye on =20
that question.

When I wanted to translate the D-W wiki interface, I went to the =20
pmwiki site [1] and asked about it. It turned out that they package =20
all the translated interfaces up in a i18n tarball, and people can =20
choose to install it or not. [2] There wasn't a translation for my =20
language, so I did one there (very welcoming and helpful community =20
and mailing list, very active and creative!), and it was immediately =20
packaged up into an updated i18n tarball. More, we had some UTF-8 =20
display problems with our existing wiki software, and they fixed that =20=

straight away! This has made me a keen pmwiki supporter. ;)

The VNOSS wiki uses wakkawiki (wikini?) [3], and the Translate Wiki =20
[4] uses dokuwiki, because it also handles UTF-8 well, and I really =20
find its interface the easiest to read, and to use. I'll try to find =20
out if moinmoin has a similar approach to translation ... but I =20
personally find its interface non-intuitive and hard to read, so I'm =20
having trouble feeling enthusiastic about it. I wonder how committed =20
the Gnome Live admins are to their wiki software... ;)

Thanks very much for the appreciation and feedback, M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn. I =
agree =20
about the subpages. I'm also asking the gnome-i18n list and the =20
Translate project at Sourceforge for some feedback, so I hope to fine-=20=

tune it a bit. Danilo will probably have a minor fit at having his =20

That was a happy surprise, when I went back to it yesterday! Thanks a =20=

lot! (I really prefer the dokuwiki TOC, it doesn't take up the middle =20=

of the page, but creates a sidebox in the top right-hand-corner.) And =20=

thanks for the tag. I really think the help pages could be improved. =20
Where did you find that one?

It's great to put in the effort and have support and help with it. =20
Thankyou. It encourages me very much. :)

As I understand it, MoinMoin is usually chosen because it is written in
the programming language Python. This has a few calls on people: there
are a lot of people who like Python, and Python (among others) is seen
as more secure than PHP, which many wikis are written in.

I actually really dislike MoinMoin as a user (I don't know about it as
an administrator or developer). I much prefer MediaWiki (which is in
PHP), the wiki software used for Wikipedia et al, which has a saner
markup, fewer i18n bugs, a more open development community and a few
other things.

However, it unfortunately tends to be pretty hard to switch an active
wiki to new software. Most wikis use their own custom varient version of
wiki markup (MoinMoin and MediaWiki markup is pretty different), and
store their data in incompatible formats. You are therefore locked into
your choice of wiki to some extent. I don't know how long the GNOME Live
one has been around... probably long enough to have this effect.

Yes, that's definitely my first priority. Then I have somewhere to =20
send people, and hopefully the search engines will pick it up. Can we =20=

include meta tags for search engines?

Yes, that's how I've done it elswhere. It saves a lot of messing =20
around, and avoids inconsistencies between original and translated =20
pages.

We're also going to need a Translation in Progress page (as in the D-=20
W wiki), including this information, and keeping track of who is =20
translating what, contact people etc., once this gets going. I'd be =20
happy to do that, and to keep track of all translators and translations.

That's actually much simpler than other structures I've used. =20
Thankyou. :)  Trying to use WikiLinks with UTF-8 doesn't work in any =20

in any language that uses accents for meaning, as mine does; allowing =20=

too much flexibility in link renaming can lead to a lot of muddle. =20
Your pattern makes sense to me.

Perfect sense. Thankyou. I've got somewhere to start. :)

A giggle moment: my fourteen-yr-old, who has had cancer, is still ill =20=

at home, and studying by distance learning: today, during their =20
teleconference lesson, they lost their teacher! The operator was =20
searching for her, the kids were wondering what was going on, and all =20=

in all it was a fun moment. Me being a pest, when Trinh said, "We've =20
lost our teacher, what do we do?" I answered, "Where did you put her =20
last?" and broke up.

I visualize this hanging telephone receiver, swinging quietly in the =20
breeze, and a big question mark over it. :D

I have taught a lot by distance learning (mostly the very early =20
computer-network efforts, with live simultaneous participation, well =20
before the Net), and there was always the fun of wondering what was =20
going to go wrong next. :D  I think it relaxed the students: they =20
were always keen to participate!

Now, to, uh, whatever it was I was doing...

Yes, I'm sure you're right. A bit like an unsatisfactory partner: you =20=

have to decide whether the hassle of having them around is worse than =20=

the hassle of getting rid of them. :D

One of the things I dislike most about the varying wikis is the =20
similarity but small difference between markup. You really need to =20
learn each one separately, and have the key next to you, so you =20
remember, no, this isn't the wiki that uses double square brackets =20
for links, this one only uses single square brackets, but double for =20
footnotes, where wiki 3 uses one round bracket for footnotes... etc. =20
They're not different enough to stick in your mind (at least, not in =20
mine when I use several different wikis from time to time), but =20
they're different enough not to work!

I agree with you that MediaWiki is a good one, I forgot that one when =20=

discussing wikis. Its layout and display are definitely superior!

:)  Marcelo is _quick_! I hope he's on the Gnome translating team. :D

Mine is up:

http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen_2fViVietnamese

I had to go into more detail, because many women in my community are =20
only just starting out with computers, if that, and may not know what =20=

a mailing list was, let alone IRC. So I gave more instructions, and =20
also said they could contact me if they were having problems joining =20
either.

I did some pages in Vietnamese, before, for the D-W wiki, and I =20
received an email yesterday that is fairly typical: a lady who'd =20
found the pages by searching for something to help Vietnamese women. =20
She needed help setting up her browser to view our language. She =20
thought the whole of D-W _was_ those pages in our language, and was =20
very excited that someone cared enough to do that, and was (this is =20
hard to translate, more culturally than linguistically) important =20
enough to do it, that women helping other women had enough status to =20
appear online.

So we may get low-level entrants, but I'm happy to support them. Just =20=

getting people online and functioning is such a big step in empowerment.

Hope you like the page. I think it looks dreadful, but that's more =20
moinmoin than my text, I hope. :)

Time to run a keen eye down the translation status pages for my =20
language. We're in string freeze, preparatory to release, and you =20
have to watch those developers _very_ carefully... :D  (some of them =20
keep modified strings in their hip pockets, just waiting for  a =20
translator to nod off so they can sneak them into the file. Hmm, I'm =20
starting to suffer from a highly-specialized type of paranoia here...)

Hi guys,

For those of you who may be lurking and want to contribute, but are not
sure how - this seems to be a pretty straightforward project to help
GNOME that doesn't involve any special technical skills but requires
good writing skills. If any of you are talented writers, please consider
this project!

Hi guys,

Over the weekend, Luchezar Petkov (Slash / Manowarrior in the IRC
channel) has contributed a Bulgarian translation of the wiki page:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen_2fBgBulgarian Thanks Luchezar! :)

I also fiddled around with the mailman mailing list pages to try to make
them more informative and a little more attractive:

Hi everybody :)

Sorry if I haven't responded to mails: I've had my head down trying =20
to get the Gnome 2.12 and Debian Installer releases up to date (why =20
on earth they're happening concurrently, except to drive translators =20
insane, I do not know).

I've been translating the Gnome 2.12 release notes today, which =20
included ploughing through a l-o-n-g list of people who were being =20
thanked individually for their special contributions, things that had =20=

made so much difference, they deserved this moment of fame.

One woman. One. :(

I don't know her personally, but thankyou, Irene Ryan, for giving the =20=

rest of us hope of becoming visible.

Is this simply a sign that there are far too few women involved in =20
Gnome, and in free software generally, or is it something else? In =20
either case, I hope we can change this situation.

Back to the release notes...

So here's my first stab at some content for our web page together:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomenWebPageDraft

It's frustrating how long it's taken to get everything set up. I think
the main issue is that we don't have enough recruits. It's hard to
actively recruit because we don't have a web site to point people at in
order to recruit, so not many people know about the project.

What is blocking the web site? Well, not having a logo. But no longer; I
think we should just get the content up, sans prettiness if we have to,
and we can always pretty it up later.

Which leads me to another topic - the logo contest results. Some logos
have received multiple votes from the same ip address, something I
enabled in the polling system because I knew a few people voting in the
poll were going to show up as having the same ip address from nat pools,
etc. This proved to be an unwise decision as some logos received as many
as 15 votes (40% of the total vote!) from the same IP address, and it's
unclear how to proceed. As Diana is the resident graphic designer, I'd
like leave the final decision in her hands, but I'm not sure how
everyone else feels about it.

Anyway, just an update from my front; my goal is to get a bare-bones web
site up by the end of this week and to then start sending emails out. It
would be nice to send announcements to university computer science
departments. Does this seem like a good plan? I can also talk to the
Marketing team and see if they'd be cool with a spot on the gnome.org
front page to point at the GNOME Women web site sometime in the future.

Do you want help with the site?

I'm OK in basic html/css.

I'm also happy to get a translation going for the site, so I could =20
translate text as it's created, if you like.

I think getting Gnome themselves, as well as the other womens' OSS =20
groups, to mention us, is a good idea. :)

I've seen one or two women translators on the gnome-i18n list whom =20
I'd like to invite here. It will be a lot easier when we have a =20
website to which we can point.

We also need to get some helpful information up there, and start some =20=

discussions here. Maybe an IRC channel, some quick tutes to help =20
people get started or solve common issues. These are all the things =20
that work for Debian-Women, so I'm keen to get them started here.

One thing that doesn't work for D-W is that it has become a far too =20
vehement site, where newbies and many women in general don't feel =20
comfortable posting. I would really like to see this group stay low-=20
key in that respect: yes, we can discuss technical issues and social =20
issues affecting us, but let's give people a bit of elbow-room, be =20
tolerant of mistakes and encourage new people.

My 5c for now (no 2c coins in Australia these days). :)

GNOME women has had an IRC channel for longer than it has had a mailing
list. It's #gnome-women on irc.gimp.net. That could use a mention on the
page.

Definitely. We need all the "getting-started" info up there, and any =20

I'm a good reference point myself, since I have trouble remembering =20
things. You can use me as an ongoing newbie. :D

Not to get too off-topic, but could you please avoid insulting DW on
random other lists? It'd be pretty classy of you to do that.

Erinn, I had no intention of insulting D-W at all. I simply said that =20=

I still love ASCII art...

I encountered a webpage the other day which had some basic =20

Oh, svashka, you've found the biggest problem in i18n. :(

Everybody has their own system, some groups can be parochial, and for =20=

most translators, it's a matter of trying to remember what to do in =20
which project, and not getting too confused!

Please have a look at the Translate Wiki for this:

http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/

and the link "Localization Guide", which has a lot of information =20
about different projects, including my info on the Translation =20
Project at the University of Montreal, a central project which =20
doesn't limit itself to specific distributions, so, like Pootle, has =20
great potential to break down some of the barriers in i18n. I would =20
encourage you very strongly to join the Translation Project. It's my =20
favourite i18n place. :)

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/HTML/index.html

I know the coordinator will be delighted to hear from you: I know her =20=

well, and would be happy to recommend you. I'm just looking to see =20
what Indic teams there are there...

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/registry.cgi?team=3Dindex

Hmm, there's a Hindi and a Punjabi team, but not Marathi or Sanskrit. =20=

You could start one. I'd be happy to help. :)

You can see my team page here:

http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/registry.cgi?team=3Dvi

For Gnome, you can start here:

http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/

and please ask me any questions you like. Gnome is, in my experience, =20=

the best-organized individual project (after the general TP and =20
Pootle), and has some very supportive coordinators who are keen to =20
help. You can also pop up on the gnome-i18n list and ask about your =20
language(s).

I wish so much that we did all the i18n in one, integrated way (with =20
flexibility for input methods) for everyone, but that's not happening =20=

yet. :(

I get so confused sometimes, swapping from TP to Gnome to Debian to D-=20=

W to individual projects like BitTorrent or Psi... so I can help you =20
get confused too! :D

Start from the main pages I've listed, and ask questions! The main =20
sites have information both on joining an existing team, and on =20
forming a new team. You will find other translators very helpful: =20
you're not alone in this task, even if you're the only person in your =20=

team. Mostly, I've been the only Vietnamese translator world-wide :=20
( but I've always had support from and been able to share with other =20
translators. :)

So you meet the same translators on all the lists we have to join... ;)

I'm really impressed with how you've taken the risk to appear on new =20
lists, and ask questions which are not readily understood. Keep it =20
up! Let's hope more people, especially women, follow your example. :)

Hey, today when I was updating the gedit file, one edit was to =20
include "Marathi" language for the first time!

svashka, wave that flag!

Gnome has a really impressive array of translation teams and =20
languages. It's a testament to its vital translation program and keen =20=

workers. :)

My co-ordinator emailed me today, with a typo (which I'd fixed =20
<smugly>) and a pat on the back, which I think we all need, to keep =20
on going in what can be a very confusing and lonely area.

I think we should have a Pat on the Back Co-operative, for those =20
times when nobody seems to appreciate you! I hereby contribute my =20
Pat, and I hope we can build up a good store for those "You've =20
changed the strings AGAIN??!!" moments.

I'm not sure about the format: png?

<tries to compress a pat on the back>

Hey! Come back here!

This may not be a trivial task... :S

Well, one thing you fail to recognize is that there is a difficult
balance to maintain. (Highly) technical people involved are totally
underwhelmed by some technology and do not want to use it and in our
case, they tend to be the people in charge of how things get done; CVS
may be easy for committing purposes, but it also sucks. Highly technical
discussion may be off-putting to some newbies, but it's interesting to
non-newbies and *they* will leave if the level of discourse does not
match their experience. So, sure -- it's possible that DW has some of
these issues, but it's absolutely NOT specific to DW and had I known you
felt this was an issue, I would've patiently listened to your ideas for
improving it and seeing what could be done. Alas.

Either way, it would've been totally appropriate to bring this up on
DW's list, but the fact that you brought it up here instead -- without
any real desire for resolution -- is what makes it insulting.

There's very much two separate potential threads here.

Thread 1: how can GNOME Women maintain a balance between not scaring off
newer, less technical potential women contributors to GNOME and keeping
the interest of more technical contributors to the project (both women
and men)? Specific examples from the experience of other groups *may* be
useful here, *especially* where they have already found a solution. (I
can think of various examples from LinuxChix that people may find
useful.) But specific is much better than general, and positive better
than negative. "Debian Women/KDE Women/LinuxChix/GNOME in general are
really bad, let's do better" is risky territory. Each of those projects
has its own context and will choose its own balance.

I expect GNOME Women to be a pretty different place from LinuxChix, but
that's because LinuxChix is a support and social group for women Linux
users and GNOME Women is (I gather) a mentoring group for potential and
existing women GNOME developers, not because either of them sucks.

Thread 2: "Debian Women has got this wrong." (Quotes because I want to
make it clear it's not my opinion.) I agree with Erinn, Thread 2 is both
off-topic and potentially damaging here, move it to Debian Women.

, 2005-08-10 - 11:14 +1000-, Mary Gardiner :
hi all,

Was following this thread for a while and well flamefests are not really
a nice way to start off a new venture. So perhaps this thread can be
terminated right here. 
>

The reason I joined gnome-women and linuxchix (tho not full-throttle
yet) is for the simple reason that i was the lonely-only girl in the
linux-user-group and l10n-team that i have been part of for the past 3
years. during these times i saw very different approaches being metted
out to ppl like newbies, techie-newbies, non-newbies, partial-interest-
groups(like me who are only interested in bits and pieces of the talk),
women-techies. More often than not a few of the all-rounders in the team
tend to overshadow the proceedings due to which seemingly "unimportant"
issues (which might be of huge importance for a new-linux-user) are left
unattended or distraughtly dealt with. this results in intimidating the
rest of the people in the group. Same happens with women in someplaces
where they are taken as non-serious or secondary players even after
showing immense skills. this makes women or for that matter any other
person conscious about  their level of  participation. this phenomenon
would perhaps vary in different parts of the globe. 

for me forums like gnome-women mean a place where i can air my views or
participate in the projects/proceedings and learn about the many nitty-
gritties that are often left unsaid or one is afraid to ask in a wider
forum, without inhibitions as i know i wouldnt be condemned as a second-
grade group member.

just my 2 ps

regards
Runa

I'm happy to do this: I've been trying to raise some of these issues =20
there for some time.

I would like to point out that I did not say "Debian Women has got =20
this wrong". I said there were some things that were working for D-W, =20=

and some things that weren't.

Is it possible for you to summarise these issues on this list as
positive suggestions for GNOME Women? For example, instead of saying
"D-W doesn't do X", you could simply suggest to us that "G-W should do X
because it would have Y benefits" without referring to D-W at all. (On
the other hand, if there's things that D-W does that you see as good,
praise them everywhere ;) )

Of course.

 =46rom talking to other women translators and developers, mostly new =20=

ones, who don't feel they have the confidence to take on "mainstream" =20=

groups, I think our group needs:

1. to be welcoming: make a point of welcoming new people, show an =20
interest in their background, invite them to share about what they do =20=

and what they want to achieve

Post: Welcome, X, to the Gnome Women list! It's great to see you =20
posting here for the first time. So you're working in Y? That must be =20=

interesting, bearing in mind the Z situation. We'd be interested to =20
hear what it's been like for you, as a woman in that field.

As for your question about AA, there are several options you could =20
usefully investigate... (etc.)


2. to be tolerant: we all make mistakes. If someone is unclear, makes =20=

a mistake or hasn't looked at the usual information, be polite and =20
helpful, give them good examples and encourage them to follow =20
effective models of practice

Example:

New poster: I dont knnow where find group to tryanslate (language X)

Response: Welcome to the Gnome-Women list! Gnome has a vibrant and =20
welcoming translation community. Please look at the main translation =20
project page (Y). I notice on the teams page (Z) that there isn't a =20
team for your language yet, but you can contact (ZZ) and ask about =20
forming a team. Please tell him/her you're a member of Gnome-Women, =20
and please keep asking questions here: we help each other. :)

as opposed to:

(link)

I'm happy to do that for translators, but I think it helps any new =20
enquirer, so perhaps other Gnome Women could volunteer to be focal =20
people for different Gnome areas.

New people don't _want_ to look silly or ignorant: most of the time =20
people are doing their best under the circumstances. Cut them some =20
slack.

Example:

Poster X advertizes her company on the group.

Response: We're really interested to hear about your company, but =20
this list isn't the place to advertize. Please have a look (here). =20
We'd really like to hear about what it's like for women workers at =20
your company: what has it been like for you?

This may all be obvious, but somehow it doesn't happen. :(

3. Read emails carefully. It sounds crazy to have to say that, but so =20=

often I've seen new posters put off by having their questions =20
ignored, and being confused and upset by suddenly receiving responses =20=

about something else. If we're not entirely sure what someone means, =20
we can ask polite questions:

Poster: I can't find gnomewomen page

Respone: Hi, X. Good to hear from you. Which Gnome Women page are you =20=

looking for? (Of course, they're all equally wonderful. ;) ) What =20
information are you looking for?

as opposed to:

(link)

These types of responses take more time, but I think it's worth doing =20=

one post like that, than sending in several that aren't welcoming and =20=

helpful.

Everyone has their own style, but welcoming and helpful should be =20
part of it in a group like this, IMHO.

4. Celebrate achievement.

Example:

Package X is gnomewomen member Y's first package. It's in testing.

Post: Our new Gnome Woman package maintainer, Y, has her first =20
package in testing now! It can be a long trail, but worth it in the =20
end. Keep all your non-keyboarding fingers crossed for this possibly =20
nervous package. (How would _you_ feel if you were in testing? ;) )

Y, how has it been getting your package to this stage? What have been =20=

the high points and low points, so far? I had awful problems with A, =20
but B was pretty easy, considering C. D helped me a lot with that.

Example:

Post: We want to hear what you're doing this month. Do you have =20
anything you really want to get out of the way in (month)? Let's put =20
up a page of current projects, and highlight milestones. In my case, =20
I want to get Y done. I need to start (here), and do (this) first, =20
but I think I can get (this) done by (then). My best resource is =20
(this), and in time management I focus on (that). How about you?

This is a way to help spread good models of practice, reinforce skills.

Post: Gnome Woman X popped up on our IRC channel for the first time =20
last night, Y time. Good to see you there! We had a very useful chat =20
about Z, in between bad jokes about AA. Is there anyone here who =20
would like to chat on the channel, but doesn't know where to begin? =20
We've got an IRC primer (here), but please ask questions on the list, =20=

too. We all had to start at the beginning once. ;)

etc.

5. Keep it cool.

Post: (non-welcoming, abrupt, not reading the original etc.)

Response: Z, I know you can help X with her question: (question =20
restated). We need to remember that different people have different =20
levels of expertise. Where do you think she should start in =20
addressing (question restated)?

Then the original poster isn't confused by wondering if she's =20
expressed herself properly, and can keep hoping to get some actual help.

Managing poster behaviour is _not_ easy, but if there are a core =20
group of Gnome Women consistently being welcoming and helpful, I =20
think the occasional less-accepting post will be bearable for new and =20=

less confident people. They're looking at the majority behaviour, and =20=

thinking, "Can I do this? Can I take the risk that Z will talk like =20
that to me? But X and Y are always helpful, I can ask, and at a pinch =20=

I might be able to email one of them. It feels like an accepting place."

6. Invite people to join the list. My i18n coordinator for Debian =20
invited me to join the D-W list, which I didn't even know existed, =20
and I really appreciated the invitation. Let's target one or two =20
invitations each month per Gnome Women, and see whom we find.

That's just a few ideas, anyway. I hope they are useful. :)

Thanks Clytie, this is a very neatly collated-list of the basic problems 
  that most of us face in countries where women are new to the 
tech-world and thats the reason we tend to yearn for forums where we are 
not made to look silly and can be comparitively comfortable. Same goes 
for newbies.

Forums like DW or GW  stretch beyond geographical boundaries and can 
perhaps help set the precedent for the other existing or new forums like 
regional lugs etc. :)

Runa

Hi Clytie,

Thanks for these suggestions. I hope both we and you can put them into
practice on the GNOME Women lists. (You get to be as "old hand" as any
of us, on such a new list ;) )

Thankyou for appreciating it. It's always hard to summarize such a =20
big topic. It really helps to hear what you say. :)

Oh, I hope so. I know a lot of the regional LUGs can be quite =20
unpleasant for us, really "men-only" areas where you get the worst =20
kind of reception. :(  Unfortunately, there are plenty of places =20
online which are the same. D-W and G-W have the opportunity to hold =20
out a hand of encouragement to all the women who are struggling to =20
improve their cultural situation through the tech. explosion. I =20
really want to see more Asian women here and on D-W. We can help each =20=

other so much. :)  (I want to see women from all areas and occupations!)

Thankyou very much for appreciating them. I also hope we can =20
encourage people here. I do like the idea of a new list making it =20
easier for people to take the plunge. ;)

Hi Elnaz,

Thanks for your contribution! It's cute, but we've discussed similar
logo ideas in the past [1] and decided that "making up" the GNOME foot
to be cutesy/girly would make it harder for us to be taken seriously
within the community.

The logo thing is pretty much up in the air right now though, so if you
have other ideas feel free to post them!

Hey Clytie, help would be really appreciated! The thing that I'm worried
most about is content; I feel like we definitely want to go into more
detail on each of the different ways people can contribute... you have
good knowledge of how the translation teams work so maybe you'd like to
write up a document talking about some of the issues involved in
translating and how to get started? Your reply to svaksha [1] is a good
start on content for it!

Basically I'd like to use the wiki as a space to draft text for the
website. I think it's better to have an actual website though because if
we just rely on the wiki, anybody can register an account and mess with
the content (I'm thinking of that crazy "death to women's rights" guy
who attacked Debian Women and Linuxchix.) 

Setting up a website on gnome.org is a little complicated but I'm going
to try to spend some time on that today.

When our content gets to that point, that would be great! :)

Awesome! Feel free to point them towards the wiki in the meantime!

Yep, some of the Debian-Women ones are really good too, so we'll
probably want to link to them as well. It would be good to come up with
a list of what topics are the most in need of tutorials.

Thankyou, that's a very helpful suggestion. I'm currently writing a =20
lot of personal email on basic translation practices, so getting it =20
up somewhere I could point people to would be a good use of time. I =20
could include links to the Translate Wiki, the Gnome translator pages =20=

etc.

A password works for the D-W wiki: do you want to protect ours with =20
one? We just mail the password privately, or over IRC, to anyone who =20
wants to help with the wiki.

It's a good draft vehicle, and even might simplify the process of =20
getting stuff up on the main site, by allowing contributors to create =20=

their stuff there, then have focus people who transfer it to the site.

Certainly a little complicated. :) I think it is with any big org: =20
I'm still having svn probs with debian.org, although I got ssh =20
through today, which was a big help. Gnome CVS was difficult, too, =20
but once I had it working, it's been a big time-saver.

1. Write content.
2. Translate it.

I'll do that. You really want to do these things when people are =20
ready, or show an interest. That's where having stuff online is such =20
a great resource.

I think our two groups supporting each other, linking together, etc. =20
is a really good idea. Translators certainly cross project =20
boundaries, and it's not as though Gnome were a different OS. There =20
must be a huge number of Debian users who also use Gnome, so we could =20=

work together on a lot of things, certainly refer people between the =20
two groups.

I am _not_ going to spend the whole day on email today. (I did say =20
that.)

Hi everybody :)

I know I must be missing something obvious, but I can't find the G-W =20
wiki, to put up the introductory article for new translators.

It's not linked from the main G-W page. It's not in our mailing list =20
footer, or headers. The link has not been quoted in any of the posts =20
since I joined (25/6/05). I searched our list archives under "link =20
wiki" and came up empty. I googled with several combinations of =20
Gnome, Women and wiki, and didn't find the link. [1]

Come out, come out, wherever you are! :D

It would be great to have the wiki link on the main G-W page, as I =20
notice the IRC list link already is. I think it might be a good idea =20
to have the main page link, and/or IRC and wiki links, in the list =20
footer, if that's not too much bulk. Just the main page link would =20
find both IRC and the wiki for the person looking, once they are both =20=

there.

So <cough of embarrassment>, would someone kindly direct me out of my =20=

witless wanderings, to the Gnome-Women Wiki? :)

I can draft the article anyway, but I do need somewhere to put it. ;)

The wiki is at http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen (I posted a link to
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomenWebPageDraft earlier. I moved that
content to http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen on Friday - sorry for
forgetting to send notice to the list!) 

All of http://live.gnome.org/ is a wiki - You can create a wiki account
by going to the user preferences page (the first, leftmost extremely
tiny icon picture of a piece of paper and pencil in the upper right -
terrible ui). This brings you to http://live.gnome.org/UserPreferences .
Fill out the form at the top of the UserPreferences page to get a wiki
account, click the "create profile" button (don't click "mail me my
account data" as I always end up clicking by accident...! :) ) Then, I
think you need to check your email to get your password, and fill out
that horribly confusing form again
(http://live.gnome.org/UserPreferences) this time clicking on the
"login" button.

> I can draft the article anyway, but I do need somewhere to put it. ;)

I look forward to seeing it! :)

p.s. I made a typo in the list address when I first sent this so

There is a link called UserPreferences, but the pencil and paper icon =20=

is for editing the current page. It is a terrible UI, I agree. The =20
wiki is evidently partly translated into my language, but there are =20
errors, and quite a bit untranslated. Do you know where I would go to =20=

work on the translation? I want to make it easier for other =20

Thankyou, I don't think I could have worked it out without your help! =20=

What a weird wiki setup. Which wiki is it? I think I saw a moinmoin =20
error message when I was searching: that's not a wiki I've personally =20=

translated, and I don't think I've used it yet. All learning time. :)

Boy, did it end up a _lot_ longer than I thought. At least, there =20
should be anchors in the wiki. I didn't realize how much I'd had to =20
learn at Gnome, which wasn't easy to find. I hope I've saved other =20
people the same blundering about. :)

Now to wikify the article...

Ugh, yeah my bad, there isn't even an icon for logging in. You just have
to be lucky enough to see the link to UserPreferences on the bottom of
the front page.

I created a new OpenQuestion on how to submit translations of the wiki
(see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeLiveWiki)- I'm going to ask around to
see if I can find this out for you, though.

Yep, after looking around a bit I verified it is moinmoin.

It looks really good - thorough, very encouraging, and I'm sure really
helpful for getting up and running in translation. You may want to break
it up into some subpages - It might be a little intimidating for
newcomers to see just how much they need to learn all at once o_O. 

I added a list of anchors to the article for you - the tag to do this
automagically is [[TableOfContents]]. :-)

Ok, so I asked jdub about this - basically, there isn't any built-in way
of adding translations to moinmoin wikis. He is actually looking into
developing such a feature himself. In the meantime, he suggested we use
wiki subpages for adding translations to pages in the wiki. The
"standard" we could use for naming the subpages is [language
code][language name] like so: ViVietnamese. Also, we should provide
links to the translation of each translated page on the bottom.

So, for example, on the bottom of http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen I
added a link to "GnomeWomen/ViVietnamese" - the "GnomeWomen/" is added
to the beginning rather than just using ViVietnamese. This allows the
creation of a ViVietnamese subpage underneath the main GnomeWomen page.

So anyway, Clytie, there is a page set up off of GnomeWomen (on the
bottom) so you could go ahead and start translating the GnomeWomen page.
What you should do is copy/paste the page content from an editing screen
(so you get the wiki formatting); then, wherever there are links to
other pages (for example, on GnomeWomen you added the page
GnomeWomenTrans) add a "/ViVietnamese" to the end, so you'd change
GnomeWomenTrans to GnomeWomenTrans/ViVietnamese in the Vietnamese
translation page (GnomeWomen/ViVietnamese).

Does this make sense? Let me know if you need any clarification! I think
it'll make sense if you take a look at GnomeWomen now.

Bug days are a great learning opportunity and a good way to begin
getting involved with GNOME. Let me know if you are interested...
details below...

Subject: [gnome-love] Bug day tomorrow! With our unique rockbugmaster!
To: bugsquad <gnome-bugsquad@gnome.org>, gnome-love@gnome.org,
gnome-list@gnome.org


Heya!

I know everyone was waiting for this mail. I know it. It's been one
month since the last bug day and it's hard to live without having your
weekly bug day. So it comes back. Tomorrow.

And you know what? The imposing, the surprising, the fantastic, the only
LUIS VILLA will be here. Yes. Luis Villa. The one who launched the GNOME
bug days. No, he's not that old ;-)

If you want to meet Luis Villa, join us. And maybe he'll talk with you.
In fact, I'm sure he'll talk with you: he'll be really happy that his
exam of tonight will be ended that he'll talk with everyone. And he will
even hug you as you join #bugs. If he doesn't, just ask him to do it.

You're now convinced you should come to this bug day, aren't you? But
you don't know where it happens and when? It's really easy:

+ irc.gnome.org #bugs is where all the good action will occur
+ Thursday, august 18th is the day you should mark on your
calendar
+ 1500GMT->0300GMT is the right time to join (but there should be people
before and after to help you)

And now, for the standard part of the announcement:

What is this thing you call 'bug day'?
======================================

Bug day is a day we get together on IRC, find bugs, and clean bugzilla
so that developers can get more work done by focusing on bugs that
matter instead of duplicates, unconfirmable bugs, and things that
they've already closed.

Who can help at a bug day?
==========================

Virtually anyone. Bug day can be for the very timid, the very quiet, or
the very persistent.

You do need:
* decent ability to read English
* a user-level knowledge of GNOME
* 30 or so minutes of the day (the first time, after that you can do it
in very small chunks.)

You don't need:
* any programming ability
* any prior experience with QA
* a deep understanding of GNOME.

On the other hand, if you do have programming ability, it's also a great
way to get involved- after a few bug days, you can figure out what needs
help in gnome quickly and apply your talents there.

What will we focus on?
======================

Focus this week will be on unconfirmed bugs - reading them, marking them
NEEDINFO if needed, confirming them if they are still in a newer
release, finding duplicates, etc. Easy and fun.

Where can I get more information?
=================================

Bug days have a wiki page now:
http://live.gnome.org/Bugsquad/BugDays

Hello everybody, and thankyou very much to M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn for her =
helpful =20
reply. :)

It's certainly not the most new-user-friendly wiki I've seen. :S

Thanks very much, M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn, for both efforts. :)  I'll keep an =
eye on =20
that question.

When I wanted to translate the D-W wiki interface, I went to the =20
pmwiki site [1] and asked about it. It turned out that they package =20
all the translated interfaces up in a i18n tarball, and people can =20
choose to install it or not. [2] There wasn't a translation for my =20
language, so I did one there (very welcoming and helpful community =20
and mailing list, very active and creative!), and it was immediately =20
packaged up into an updated i18n tarball. More, we had some UTF-8 =20
display problems with our existing wiki software, and they fixed that =20=

straight away! This has made me a keen pmwiki supporter. ;)

The VNOSS wiki uses wakkawiki (wikini?) [3], and the Translate Wiki =20
[4] uses dokuwiki, because it also handles UTF-8 well, and I really =20
find its interface the easiest to read, and to use. I'll try to find =20
out if moinmoin has a similar approach to translation ... but I =20
personally find its interface non-intuitive and hard to read, so I'm =20
having trouble feeling enthusiastic about it. I wonder how committed =20
the Gnome Live admins are to their wiki software... ;)

Thanks very much for the appreciation and feedback, M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn. I =
agree =20
about the subpages. I'm also asking the gnome-i18n list and the =20
Translate project at Sourceforge for some feedback, so I hope to fine-=20=

tune it a bit. Danilo will probably have a minor fit at having his =20
praises sung publically. :D

That was a happy surprise, when I went back to it yesterday! Thanks a =20=

lot! (I really prefer the dokuwiki TOC, it doesn't take up the middle =20=

of the page, but creates a sidebox in the top right-hand-corner.) And =20=

thanks for the tag. I really think the help pages could be improved. =20
Where did you find that one?

It's great to put in the effort and have support and help with it. =20
Thankyou. It encourages me very much. :)

As I understand it, MoinMoin is usually chosen because it is written in
the programming language Python. This has a few calls on people: there
are a lot of people who like Python, and Python (among others) is seen
as more secure than PHP, which many wikis are written in.

I actually really dislike MoinMoin as a user (I don't know about it as
an administrator or developer). I much prefer MediaWiki (which is in
PHP), the wiki software used for Wikipedia et al, which has a saner
markup, fewer i18n bugs, a more open development community and a few
other things.

However, it unfortunately tends to be pretty hard to switch an active
wiki to new software. Most wikis use their own custom varient version of
wiki markup (MoinMoin and MediaWiki markup is pretty different), and
store their data in incompatible formats. You are therefore locked into
your choice of wiki to some extent. I don't know how long the GNOME Live
one has been around... probably long enough to have this effect.

I should have read all the posts before replying, but I forget things =20=

then. Sorry.

Yes, that's definitely my first priority. Then I have somewhere to =20

include meta tags for search engines?

Yes, that's how I've done it elswhere. It saves a lot of messing =20
around, and avoids inconsistencies between original and translated =20
pages.

We're also going to need a Translation in Progress page (as in the D-=20
W wiki), including this information, and keeping track of who is =20
translating what, contact people etc., once this gets going. I'd be =20
happy to do that, and to keep track of all translators and translations.

That's actually much simpler than other structures I've used. =20
Thankyou. :)  Trying to use WikiLinks with UTF-8 doesn't work in any =20

in any language that uses accents for meaning, as mine does; allowing =20=

Your pattern makes sense to me.

Perfect sense. Thankyou. I've got somewhere to start. :)

A giggle moment: my fourteen-yr-old, who has had cancer, is still ill =20=

at home, and studying by distance learning: today, during their =20
teleconference lesson, they lost their teacher! The operator was =20
searching for her, the kids were wondering what was going on, and all =20=

in all it was a fun moment. Me being a pest, when Trinh said, "We've =20
lost our teacher, what do we do?" I answered, "Where did you put her =20
last?" and broke up.

I visualize this hanging telephone receiver, swinging quietly in the =20
breeze, and a big question mark over it. :D

I have taught a lot by distance learning (mostly the very early =20
computer-network efforts, with live simultaneous participation, well =20
before the Net), and there was always the fun of wondering what was =20
going to go wrong next. :D  I think it relaxed the students: they =20
were always keen to participate!

Now, to, uh, whatever it was I was doing...

Yes, I'm sure you're right. A bit like an unsatisfactory partner: you =20=

have to decide whether the hassle of having them around is worse than =20=

the hassle of getting rid of them. :D

One of the things I dislike most about the varying wikis is the =20
similarity but small difference between markup. You really need to =20
learn each one separately, and have the key next to you, so you =20
remember, no, this isn't the wiki that uses double square brackets =20
for links, this one only uses single square brackets, but double for =20
footnotes, where wiki 3 uses one round bracket for footnotes... etc. =20
They're not different enough to stick in your mind (at least, not in =20
mine when I use several different wikis from time to time), but =20
they're different enough not to work!

I agree with you that MediaWiki is a good one, I forgot that one when =20=

discussing wikis. Its layout and display are definitely superior!

:)  Marcelo is _quick_! I hope he's on the Gnome translating team. :D

Mine is up:

http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen_2fViVietnamese

I had to go into more detail, because many women in my community are =20
only just starting out with computers, if that, and may not know what =20=

a mailing list was, let alone IRC. So I gave more instructions, and =20
also said they could contact me if they were having problems joining =20
either.

I did some pages in Vietnamese, before, for the D-W wiki, and I =20
received an email yesterday that is fairly typical: a lady who'd =20
found the pages by searching for something to help Vietnamese women. =20
She needed help setting up her browser to view our language. She =20
thought the whole of D-W _was_ those pages in our language, and was =20
very excited that someone cared enough to do that, and was (this is =20
hard to translate, more culturally than linguistically) important =20
enough to do it, that women helping other women had enough status to =20
appear online.

So we may get low-level entrants, but I'm happy to support them. Just =20=

getting people online and functioning is such a big step in empowerment.

Hope you like the page. I think it looks dreadful, but that's more =20
moinmoin than my text, I hope. :)

Time to run a keen eye down the translation status pages for my =20
language. We're in string freeze, preparatory to release, and you =20
have to watch those developers _very_ carefully... :D  (some of them =20
keep modified strings in their hip pockets, just waiting for  a =20
translator to nod off so they can sneak them into the file. Hmm, I'm =20
starting to suffer from a highly-specialized type of paranoia here...)

Hi guys,

For those of you who may be lurking and want to contribute, but are not
sure how - this seems to be a pretty straightforward project to help
GNOME that doesn't involve any special technical skills but requires
good writing skills. If any of you are talented writers, please consider
this project!

Hi guys,

Over the weekend, Luchezar Petkov (Slash / Manowarrior in the IRC
channel) has contributed a Bulgarian translation of the wiki page:
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen_2fBgBulgarian Thanks Luchezar! :)

I also fiddled around with the mailman mailing list pages to try to make

Hi everybody :)

Sorry if I haven't responded to mails: I've had my head down trying =20
to get the Gnome 2.12 and Debian Installer releases up to date (why =20
on earth they're happening concurrently, except to drive translators =20
insane, I do not know).

I've been translating the Gnome 2.12 release notes today, which =20
included ploughing through a l-o-n-g list of people who were being =20
thanked individually for their special contributions, things that had =20=

made so much difference, they deserved this moment of fame.

One woman. One. :(

I don't know her personally, but thankyou, Irene Ryan, for giving the =20=

rest of us hope of becoming visible.

Is this simply a sign that there are far too few women involved in =20
Gnome, and in free software generally, or is it something else? In =20
either case, I hope we can change this situation.

Back to the release notes...
