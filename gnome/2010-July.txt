Hi all!

It=E2=80=99d be great to have a women=E2=80=99s dinner at GUADEC so that we=
 can all meet each other and share some ideas and experiences! It=E2=80=99s=
 best to have it in the beginning of the conference, so that we all already=
 know each other through the rest of the week. So far I found a restaurant =
called Rootz and made a reservation there for Tuesday, July 27 at 7pm for a=
 group of 10-15 people [1] [2].

They can seat us in the quietest area of the restaurant or on the terrace i=
f the weather is nice. It is located in the city center - 25 minutes walk f=
rom the conference venue and 7 minutes walk from the Mercure Hotel, where p=
eople sponsored by the foundation are staying [3].

Can you *please let me know if you can make it* as soon as possible, so tha=
t I have an accurate idea about how many people we=E2=80=99ll have. I=E2=80=
=99m open to other restaurant suggestions if people know places that would =
work better.

Look forward to meeting some of you in a week!
Marina

Great! Of course there is still room. 10-15 people was just my guess for ho=
w many people we'll have. We'll make sure there is room for as many people =
as want to join. So far we had 7 people confirm they will come.
