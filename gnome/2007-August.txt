A Women's Tech (un)Conference

October 22-23 Computer History Museum, Mountain View, CA.

Our goal is to create an open space forum for women in tech to come
together to

    1. Exchanging skills and learning from women from diverse fields of
technology.
    2. Discussing topics about women and technology.
    3. Connecting the diverse range of women in technology, computing,
entrepreneurship, funding, hardware, open source, nonprofit and any
other technical geeky field.

This is an unconference so it will have an agenda created by the people
who attend.

The Linux Expo of Southern California is proud to announce their second Women 
in Open Source Conference. The conference will be held on February 8th, 2008 
in conjunction with the 6th Annual So Cal Linux Expo. 

Continuing our efforts to encourage women of all ages to be a part of the free 
and open source community, we invite you to showcase your work on Free and 
Open Source projects. Join us in sharing your accomplishments, success 
stories, and advancements. 

Past attendees at this event have included women in technology, teachers, and 
parents of young girls. 

Widespread acceptance of the Linux Expo and participation by the user 
community have established SCALE as the premiere Open Source conference in 
the Southwest. 2008 marks the sixth year that SCALE has been engaging and 
inspiring the open source community. Our event is uniquely community-based 
and attracts a wide variety of sponsors, non-profit groups, user groups, and 
attendees.

***   LinuxChix Womens’ mini-conf: Call for Presentations   ***

The premier annual Linux and Open Source conference in Australia,
linux.conf.au, is once again hosting a LinuxChix mini-conf. We are now calling
for presentations by women on both Free Software technical topics and other
topics of general interest to women involved in Free Software or working in IT.

*About the mini-conf*

The second annual LinuxChix women’s mini-conf will be held on either Monday the
28th or Tuesday the 29th of January, 2008 (We don’t know which) at the
University of Melbourne, as part of the annual linux.conf.au Free and Open
Source Software conference running from 28th of January to the 2nd of February,
2008. All attendees of linux.conf.au are welcome to attend the women’s
mini-conf, which will highlight and celebrate the achievements of women in Free
and Open Source Software. There is no need to be an active member of LinuxChix,
as attendees and speakers from other women’s advocacy and development groups
including Systers, project-specific women’s groups and others, are encouraged
to participate.

The mini-conf has both 50 minute and 25 minute talks slots available. We
recommend that inexperienced Speakers opt for the shorter slots and plan to
present for around 15 minutes; the remaining time will be devoted to
discussion. Experienced speakers may choose to opt for a full 50 minute slot,
and prepare to talk for 35-40 minutes. We reserve the right to request that 35
minute presentations be shortened to 15 minutes to enable best use of the time
we have.

Abstracts for talk proposals should be submitted to - geekess :at:
geekosophical :dot: net - by Midnight Sunday, October 15, 2007.

There will also be some 10 minute (5 minutes talk, 5 minutes discussion)
lightning talk slots available. These slots are ideal for first-time speakers
or those who want to very quickly showcase a project.

All talks should be on Free and Open Source Software related topics.

Please see http://conf.au.linuxchix.org for more information about the women’s
mini-conference and http://conf.au.linuxchix.org/CFP for full details of the
call for presentations.

Feel free to forward this announcement to any women or groups you think would
be interested.

A Women's Tech (un)Conference

October 22-23 Computer History Museum, Mountain View, CA.

Our goal is to create an open space forum for women in tech to come
together to

    1. Exchanging skills and learning from women from diverse fields of
technology.
    2. Discussing topics about women and technology.
    3. Connecting the diverse range of women in technology, computing,
entrepreneurship, funding, hardware, open source, nonprofit and any

The Linux Expo of Southern California is proud to announce their second Women 
in Open Source Conference. The conference will be held on February 8th, 2008 
in conjunction with the 6th Annual So Cal Linux Expo. 

Continuing our efforts to encourage women of all ages to be a part of the free 
and open source community, we invite you to showcase your work on Free and 
Open Source projects. Join us in sharing your accomplishments, success 
stories, and advancements. 

Past attendees at this event have included women in technology, teachers, and 
parents of young girls. 

Widespread acceptance of the Linux Expo and participation by the user 
community have established SCALE as the premiere Open Source conference in 
the Southwest. 2008 marks the sixth year that SCALE has been engaging and 
inspiring the open source community. Our event is uniquely community-based 
and attracts a wide variety of sponsors, non-profit groups, user groups, and 
attendees.

***   LinuxChix Womens’ mini-conf: Call for Presentations   ***

The premier annual Linux and Open Source conference in Australia,
linux.conf.au, is once again hosting a LinuxChix mini-conf. We are now calling
for presentations by women on both Free Software technical topics and other
topics of general interest to women involved in Free Software or working in IT.

*About the mini-conf*

The second annual LinuxChix women’s mini-conf will be held on either Monday the
28th or Tuesday the 29th of January, 2008 (We don’t know which) at the
University of Melbourne, as part of the annual linux.conf.au Free and Open
Source Software conference running from 28th of January to the 2nd of February,
2008. All attendees of linux.conf.au are welcome to attend the women’s
mini-conf, which will highlight and celebrate the achievements of women in Free
and Open Source Software. There is no need to be an active member of LinuxChix,
as attendees and speakers from other women’s advocacy and development groups
including Systers, project-specific women’s groups and others, are encouraged
to participate.

The mini-conf has both 50 minute and 25 minute talks slots available. We
recommend that inexperienced Speakers opt for the shorter slots and plan to
present for around 15 minutes; the remaining time will be devoted to
discussion. Experienced speakers may choose to opt for a full 50 minute slot,
and prepare to talk for 35-40 minutes. We reserve the right to request that 35
minute presentations be shortened to 15 minutes to enable best use of the time
we have.

Abstracts for talk proposals should be submitted to - geekess :at:
geekosophical :dot: net - by Midnight Sunday, October 15, 2007.

There will also be some 10 minute (5 minutes talk, 5 minutes discussion)
lightning talk slots available. These slots are ideal for first-time speakers
or those who want to very quickly showcase a project.

All talks should be on Free and Open Source Software related topics.

Please see http://conf.au.linuxchix.org for more information about the women’s
mini-conference and http://conf.au.linuxchix.org/CFP for full details of the
call for presentations.

Feel free to forward this announcement to any women or groups you think would
be interested.
