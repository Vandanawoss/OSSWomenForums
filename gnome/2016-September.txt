Hi all,

Thanks to a confirmed sponsorship from the GNOME Foundation, GNOME is participating in Outreachy in the upcoming December round! Please consider adding your project idea and yourself as a mentor at https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/Outreachy/2016/DecemberMarch to help someone from an underrepresented background become a part of our community.

Because GNOME only usually has a few participants in Outreachy, we are looking to offer projects that are most strategic for GNOME. These include, but are not limited to, projects in the area of privacy, developer experience, GTK+, core experience, core applications, and web infrastructure.

Please add your ideas as soon as possible. The application period for Outreachy is already open and the application deadline is October 17.

Thanks,
Marina

dministrator

=C2=A0The Free Software Foundation (FSF), a Massachusetts 501(c)(3) charity
with a worldwide mission to protect computer user freedom, seeks a
motivated and talented Boston-based individual to be a full-time Senior
GNU/Linux Systems Administrator.

This position, reporting to the executive director and working closely
with the president, is an opportunity to make key contributions to the
organization that started the GNU Project, launched the free software
movement, and authored the GNU General Public License. The position is
part of a technical team including a counterpart Senior Systems
Administrator, a Web Developer, and many volunteers, tasked with
maintaining and improving the FSF's technology infrastructure.

The ideal candidate will be a well-rounded GNU/Linux systems
administrator who thrives on constant broad-based learning and problem-
solving. They will also be familiar with the free software community
and how it works; the position includes frequent contact and
collaboration with volunteers and many GNU developers. Together, the
Senior Systems Administrators have a great deal of influence over
technology decisions within the FSF, and do crucial work empowering
thousands of others to develop free software.

Examples of job responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0be a lead voice in the FSF's software system decisi=
on-making and
policy positions in technical areas;

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0install and maintain fully free GNU/Linux systems o=
n servers,
desktops, laptops, and embedded devices;

heir use of FSF-
owned systems;

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0monitor and improve system security and network inf=
rastructure;

 administrators
both in the office and remotely;

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0share in the on-call rotation to deal with core sys=
tem emergencies;

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0blog and speak about the technologies used at the F=
SF;

ke our major
fundraising activities;

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0fix bugs and submit patches upstream for the softwa=
re we use, and

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0occasionally help design, write, and release new so=
ftware when
existing software doesn't fit the bill.

Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in a related field, at
least five years of experience as a GNU/Linux systems administrator,
and highlight their familiarity with any of the following:

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0apt-based GNU/Linux distributions;

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0TCP/IP, BGP, DNS, FTP, NFS, DHCP, iptables;

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0any physical hardware maintenance and hacking.

distributed in as many languages as possible, multilingual candidates
will have an advantage. With our small staff of thirteen, each person
makes a clear contribution. We work hard, but offer a humane and fun
work environment at an office located in the heart of downtown Boston.
