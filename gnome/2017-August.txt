It looks like I'm the only person who voted publicly=E2=80=A6 what was the
result of this email? Did anything change for 2017? Will anything
change in 2018?

I was told by another attendee that the women's dinner was indeed open
to everyone (if this is the case, I don't feel that it was
communicated), but looking through some GUADEC pages, I just found
https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/Events/GUADEC/2017/WomensDinner
which says that it was not.

The poster which was up at the venue felt to me like it was purely for
women as there was no information about who could attend on there.

> If we want to celebrate womens' accomplishments, then they should be

> If there is concern that there might be too many attendees and the
> event would be "diluted", then it could be possible to limit the
> number of open seats available, for example to the same number as
> women attending the event.
