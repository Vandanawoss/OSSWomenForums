  I'm working really hard on reaching out to other intersectionally
marginalized POC to join the Empowermentors Collective! Here's a post and
some pretty graphics I spent hours making to help spread the word:

he
Empowermentors Collective is a skillshare, activism, and discussion network
for intersectionally marginalized people of color in the free culture and
free software movement. We see radical potential in free culture and free
software (often marketed as &#8220;open source software") to work against
ableism, racism, cissexism, heterosexism, sexism, and classism. We say
&#8220;intersectionally marginalized" to refer to people of color who
experience intersectionality, that is, the interactions of multiple systems
of oppression. This means we are open to all people of color with
disabilities, trans* people of color, queer people of color, women of
color, class oppressed people of color, etc. We are called Empowermentors
because we focus on sharing knowledge and technical skills, producing free
software and free media, and learning about and from each other. In this
way we are being mentors for one another to empower ourselves. Driving
questions: What dangers lie in private ownership over media and software as
it concentrates power over technology &amp; telecommunications? How are
race, gender, sexuality, class, and other cultural meanings coded into
technology? Does free culture necessarily topple or reproduce those in
power? Can we reconcile opposing both permission culture &amp; cultural
appropriation? Why do movements aiming to represent everyone often leave
out already marginalized groups? Why does openness and meritocracy
frequently lead to exclusion? When does equal treatment ignore preexisting
differences in power, privilege, &amp; access? Where do wefit into the free
sotware &amp; free culture community as queer people of color, women of
color, POC with disabilities, etc.&#160;? Who does the free software &amp;
free culture movement fight for&#8230;and who is leading it? View in flyer
