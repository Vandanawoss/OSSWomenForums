Good morning!

I've updated the wiki to reflect what articles we've received for Issue 17 -
Women in GNOME.  We have 4 of the 7 articles, and I'm in the process of
uploading them to our CMS, Textpattern, today. (
http://live.gnome.org/GnomeJournal/ArticleSubmissionQueue)

If you've submitted your article and I've missed it, please let me know.

If you are interested and have the time to help edit them, the help would be
appreciated.  If you're new to the GNOME Journal team and need an account
for Textpattern, please reply to the list with your name & email address and
Jim will create an account for you.  If you have questions on editing,
please let us know, and if you do edit an article it's encouraged to work
with the writer if there is a section you're not clear on.

My goal is to have all articles edited by Nov. 11th, formatting complete by
Nov. 14th and publish on Sunday, Nov. 15th.

Thank you to all our writers, I'm really looking forward to this issue.  And
thank you in advance to our editors.  Please let me know if you have any
questions.

Paul

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

For those of you who wrote articles for the upcoming GNOME Journal - Women
In Open Source edition, I need a short one to sentence bio for each of you.
If you need examples please look at past GJ articles at
http://www.gnomejournal.org/archives/ and there is almost always an "About
the Author" blurb at the end of the article.

If you can reply back to this thread, or the GJ list or email me, I'd
appreciate it.

Thanks!

Some of the people in the audience in my speech in the Gran Canaria
Desktop Summit thought that my joke about the Virgin of Emacs was
intended to make some kind of statement about women.

I was surprised by that reaction, since I had told the same joke dozens
of times and this is the first report of interpreting it that way.  In
any case, it was a misunderstanding: the only intended meaning of the
Cult of the Virgin of Emacs is to parody another Cult of the Virgin.
The whole St IGNUius routine makes fun of me, the free software
movement and religion, through parody.

To be abundantly clear, my views about women in connection with free
software are simply that they deserve freedom in using computers, just
as men do.  Some women already appreciate this freedom and have become
free software activists.  We need more people, regardless of sex, to
do this, so that someday all women, and all men, will enjoy the
freedom that free software offers.

Misunderstanding is not a good outcome.  To help avoid
misunderstandings of this kind in the future, since August I have
changed the joke so that the Virgin of Emacs can be of either sex.

The GNOME Journal team is pleased to announce Issue 17 of the GNOME Journal,
Women In Open Source.

This is our first ever issue with a unified theme and all articles were
written by women in the open source community.  The idea and execution of
this issue was created by the GNOME Women community.

The following articles are in this issue:

Telepathy, Empathy and Mission Control 5 in GNOME 2.28
Telepathy Overview
The Un-Scary Screwdriver
Where are they now? The Participants of the 2006 Women's Summer Outreach
Program
Easy Breezy Beautiful GNOME Shell
GNOME desktop testing automation and how to use Mago
Epiphany from a - not so experienced - user perspective
An Interview with Leslie Hawthorn

Thank you to our writers, and to the GNOME Women community for the idea of
this issue, including organizing the writers and article ideas.

I would also like to thank some of our new editors who help was invaluable
including Sumana Harihareswara and Zonker.
