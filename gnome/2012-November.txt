Hi all!

We have opened the application process for the new round of internships. This time the internships will include 8 Free Software organizations! The participating organizations are Deltacloud, Fedora, GNOME, JBoss, Mozilla, OpenStack, Tor, and Wikimedia.

The dates for these internships are January 2 to April 2, 2013. The application deadline is December 3, 2012. As part of the application process, we are asking women to take the time to learn about the participating projects and make a small contribution to the one they are interested in. These internship tasks include ones in software development, system administration, web development, user experience design, graphic design, documentation, and marketing.

All the program details are here:
https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen

Please consider applying for an internship, adding a project idea you can mentor, or helping us spread the word! Send the information to the universities, FOSS groups, and technical women groups, post the flyers on the university campuses or hand them out at conferences, encourage anyone who'd be a good candidate to apply, or write an update about the program on Identi.ca, Twitter, Facebook or Google+.

All the materials for helping us spread the word are here:
https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/SpreadTheWord

Thank you!
Marina

Hi all!

Kevin Carillo is a Ph.D. student in the School of Information Management at=
 Victoria University of Wellington whose research topic is about the influe=
nce of newcomer experience on contributor behaviour and performance in Free=
 and Open Source Software communities. He has put together a really well-re=
searched survey for people who started contributing to GNOME or other proje=
cts after January 2010. Please take it if you qualify! It's for technical a=
nd non-technical contributors alike!

The collected data will be released under a =E2=80=98share-alike=E2=80=99 O=
pen Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) and the published materials a=
bout the research will be publicly available. The results of this research =
will be of great interest to everyone in Free and Open Source Software and =
your response would help ensure that we have a comprehensive set of data ab=
out newcomer experiences in GNOME. It'd be great if everyone who qualifies =
in GNOME takes part in this survey!

Please complete it by this Friday, November 23. Survey link: https://limesu=
rvey.sim.vuw.ac.nz/index.php?sid=3D65151&lang=3Den

Hi all!

My university already knows about the program now and we will put posters
around the faculties this week! I wanted to give a talk too, but I have had
some personal problems I have to solve and I do not know if I will still be
able to. Anyway, if I am not able to do it for this round, I will do it for
the next :-).

Good luck to all the potenciall interns!
Patricia.

Hi all,

Kevin Carillo shared with me some interesting numbers about the participants of the newcomer experience survey so far.

Total number of participants: 276
Total number of female participants: 32
Number of GNOME participants: 37
Number of female GNOME participants: 21
Number of male GNOME participants: 16
Number of female GNOME participants who indicated that they took part in an official mentoring program in the GNOME community: 15
Number of male GNOME participants who indicated that they took part in an official mentoring program in the GNOME community: 4

These numbers of course show that the Outreach Program for Women has been very effective in getting women involved in the GNOME community and a program like it is essential to increasing the number of women in FOSS. The current numbers indicate that there are 56.8% women among GNOME newcomers and 4.6% women among newcomers in other organizations. No other organization has an outlier number of women participants like GNOME, with 1-3 women respondents from 7 other participating organizations.

In the last two years (since we started running Outreach Program for Women internships), GNOME had 45 female interns and 40 male interns (with 4 women and 4 men participating in an internship twice). I think there are three possible explanations for why there is a big gap in the number of female and male respondents who said they took part in an official mentoring program in the GNOME community:
1) Karen and I were more effective in getting the women involved in GNOME to respond.
2) Interns who participated in GSoC were less likely to interpret it as an official mentoring program in the GNOME community.
3) Women interns stay more involved in GNOME than men interns.

My guess is that it is predominantly reason 1 above, so this e-mail is my effort to reach out to more men who participated in GSoC or got involved in GNOME in the last three years in some different way. Please fill out the survey now! The survey closes in the end of the month (this Friday).

https://limesurvey.sim.vuw.ac.nz/index.php?sid=65151&lang=en

You can find more survey statistics on Kevin's blog: http://kevincarillo.org

The reason everyone who qualifies should take part in the survey is that both people inside and outside the GNOME community will look to it for information on who the newcomers to the GNOME community in the last three years were and what was their experience like. We would like this information to be as accurate as possible!

Thanks,
Marina

Hey Marina,

I didn't need the numbers to know that GOPW was a total success but it is
encouraging to see them.

Congrats to Marina and everybody who has supported the program, you guys
rock and I'm extremely proud to be part of this community.

Hi all,<br>
<br>
Kevin Carillo shared with me some interesting numbers about the participant=
s of the newcomer experience survey so far.<br>
<br>
Total number of participants: 276<br>
Total number of female participants: 32<br>
Number of GNOME participants: 37<br>
Number of female GNOME participants: 21<br>
Number of male GNOME participants: 16<br>
Number of female GNOME participants who indicated that they took part in an=
 official mentoring program in the GNOME community: 15<br>
Number of male GNOME participants who indicated that they took part in an o=
fficial mentoring program in the GNOME community: 4<br>
<br>
These numbers of course show that the Outreach Program for Women has been v=
ery effective in getting women involved in the GNOME community and a progra=
m like it is essential to increasing the number of women in FOSS. The curre=
nt numbers indicate that there are 56.8% women among GNOME newcomers and 4.=
6% women among newcomers in other organizations. No other organization has =
an outlier number of women participants like GNOME, with 1-3 women responde=
nts from 7 other participating organizations.<br>

<br>
In the last two years (since we started running Outreach Program for Women =
internships), GNOME had 45 female interns and 40 male interns (with 4 women=
 and 4 men participating in an internship twice). I think there are three p=
ossible explanations for why there is a big gap in the number of female and=
 male respondents who said they took part in an official mentoring program =
in the GNOME community:<br>

1) Karen and I were more effective in getting the women involved in GNOME t=
o respond.<br>
2) Interns who participated in GSoC were less likely to interpret it as an =
official mentoring program in the GNOME community.<br>
3) Women interns stay more involved in GNOME than men interns.<br>
<br>
My guess is that it is predominantly reason 1 above, so this e-mail is my e=
ffort to reach out to more men who participated in GSoC or got involved in =
GNOME in the last three years in some different way. Please fill out the su=
rvey now! The survey closes in the end of the month (this Friday).<br>

You can find more survey statistics on Kevin&#39;s blog: <a href=3D"http://=
kevincarillo.org" target=3D"_blank">http://kevincarillo.org</a><br>
<br>
The reason everyone who qualifies should take part in the survey is that bo=
th people inside and outside the GNOME community will look to it for inform=
ation on who the newcomers to the GNOME community in the last three years w=
ere and what was their experience like. We would like this information to b=
e as accurate as possible!<br>
