Dear all

My name is Femke Snelting and I am working with Constant, Foundation for 
Art and Media. Constant is hosting the Libre Graphics Meeting 2010 
(LGM), taking place in Brussels 27-30 May. The LGM is an important 
annual working conference for free software graphics application 
developers and users. http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org

At past LGMs there were hardly any women presenting work, and we would 
like that to change. To make a start, we'd like to make sure that female 
developers and users involved in Libre Graphics feel welcome to propose 
talks at:
http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/Conference_2010/Submit_Talk

Talks can range from 5 to 30 minutes and cover technical developments 
and/or creative work concerning the wide spectrum of Libre graphics. For 
an idea of the kind of talks that happened at other meetings, please 
have a look here:
http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2007/program.html
http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2008/index.php?lang=en&action=program
http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2009/program.php

If you present a project at LGM, there are some possibilities for support:
- A limited number of participants fitting the criteria of the IFN (see 
below) can travel with a grant from the Francophonie. Contact us 
a.s.a.p. if you think this applies to you or someone you know of.
- Through sponsoring and funding, the LGM-community gathers money to 
reimburse travel costs for developers that cannot afford their journey 
otherwise. Contact us in advance to see if you can make use of this; you 
will need to pre-finance your ticket.

If you have any other questions, please e-mail!

best,


Femke Snelting

Hi all!

Google Summer of Code is a program that offers stipends to students for working on various open source projects. It is a great way to spend your summer working on GNOME! Its application period has just opened and ends April 9. It is a good idea to sort out details such as what project you want to work on and who can be your potential mentor ahead of the application deadline.

As a Google Summer of Code student, you will have support of your mentor, other people working on the project you'll join, other program participants, the community of women in GNOME, and the whole GNOME community. People usually talk in the IRC channels, such as #soc, #gnome-women, #gnome-hackers, and project-specific channels on irc.gnome.org and also learn about each other's work through the Planet GNOME blog aggregator at http://planet.gnome.org .

Here is a GNOME page that explains the process and links to all the important information, such as the project ideas page and Google's official information about the program.

http://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2010

As an alternative to selecting a project idea on the ideas page, you can get in touch with any of the mentors who have expressed interest in mentoring technical projects for the Outreach Program for Women and define a project with them for which they can be your mentor in Google Summer of Code.

http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram#participating-projects

Please feel free to ask me if you have any questions about the application process or what could be a good project to work on. Also, please pass along this information to anyone who you think might be interested in the program.

Thanks!
Marina
