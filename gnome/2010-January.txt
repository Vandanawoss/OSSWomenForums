Hello,

My name is Christina Boumpouka, I'm an electronics and computer
engineer, currently pursuing a phd in distributed systems. I run into
the Gnome Women Outreach Program today and was intrigued, so here I
am.

I haven't really understood how the program works...so I will just
list the roles I could play and the projects I'm interested in and
maybe someone can help me narrow the list by providing availability
info for the projects.

I'm mostly interested in software development and user interface
design, but I guess I can also contribute as a tester or provide greek
translations.
The projects I'm interested in are Gnome Shell and Empathy.

Christina

Hi Christina,

Thank you for your interest in the program! We haven't defined the application process yet, but I will e-mail the list and you personally when we do.

If you have time, you can start learning and contributing to the projects you are interested in in the meantime, which will put you in a great position when applying for the Outreach Program for Women or for the Google Summer of Code.

Perhaps, Danielle or Guillaume can chime in with some pointers on how to get involved with the Empathy project.

As for the GNOME Shell project, here is a step-by-step list I've put together for learning and starting to contribute to it. There is definitely a lot of the coding and design work that can be done for the project. I also included a link that explains how to contribute translation. To my surprise, it doesn't look like GNOME Shell has been translated to Greek yet.

Step 1. Join #gnome-shell channel on irc.gnome.org
This is where people talk about GNOME Shell and where you can ask questions when you need to find out how to do something or want to decide what to work on next. The etiquette of IRC is such that you don't need to say "hi" when you join and you can lurk in the channel for a while until you have a specific question or want to share your view in a discussion. So just joining a channel is pretty non-committal. The channel is a bit quieter over the weekend and usually has some discussion going on during the day on weekdays.

Step 2. http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell#building
Follow these instructions to build GNOME Shell on your system. This build process creates a directory with the code for several modules relevant to GNOME Shell, as well as the gnome-shell module itself.

Step 3. http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Tour and http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/CheatSheet
Play around with GNOME Shell by running it and go over the Tour and Cheat Sheet pages to make sure you know about most features. The screenshots on the pages might look a little different from what you see because of the rapid development, but they are pretty accurate.

Step 4. http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Development
Go over the information and the links on the development page to learn about all the code components of the GNOME Shell. Try to make a simple change (like change a color for some component or change animation behavior) and restart the shell to see your change.

Step 5. http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design
Go over the design document and the recent mockups linked to from this page to understand the design goals and the planned feature set.

Step 6. https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=gnome-shell
Select a bug report you want to create a patch for. A bug report can contain a bug or a feature request. You can also create your own bug report. The number next to "Total Bugs" links to all the open bugs and the number next to "GNOME-love bugs" links to the open bugs that are good for a beginner to start with. You can ask me on IRC or via e-mail about what bug is a good one to start with when you are ready and we will think of something. I would generally expect that you would have a lot of questions when you are setting up or working on your first bugs, so don't hesitate to ask them!

Step 7. http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell#communication-resources and http://planet.gnome.org
In addition to IRC, there are other ways to keep up with the project, such as the mailing list, Identi.ca or Twitter, Bugzilla updates, and commit updates. You can browse or subscribe to them as you decide on your level of involvement in the project. Beyond the GNOME Shell project, Planet GNOME is an aggregator of blogs of people involved with GNOME in general and is a good place to find out what people are working on and what other projects are out there.

Step 8. http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Translations and http://l10n.gnome.org/languages
This page details how to create a translation for GNOME Shell. The process is pretty similar for creating a translation for other GNOME modules and you can get involved with contributing translations for other modules through your language translation team.

Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about GNOME Shell and I'll keep you posted about the program!

Marina

Hi Christina,

The Empathy IRC channel is #empathy on irc.gnome.org. If you have a
specific issue you're looking to solve someone can help you out there.
Guillaume (cassidy on IRC) is the Empathy maintainer, so can probably
point you in the direction of easier bugs to fix. I am 'danni' on IRC,
feel free to get in touch for any reason.

Some things that appear to be Empathy bugs (or limitations) are really
Telepathy bugs or limitations. Someone should be able to point you in
the right direction (working on Telepathy isn't really any harder to
working on Empathy).

The Empathy website is here: http://live.gnome.org/Empathy which
contains build instructions etc. Building Empathy is a lot like building
other GNOME components. If you get stuck, ask on IRC.

http://live.gnome.org/Empathy/Roadmap is a list of the bigger items we
are working on.

Translation for Empathy is handled through the GNOME Translation
Project, who I think hang out on #i18n on irc.gnome.org.

Hope this helps!

Hi GNOME Women,

I'm setting up our Google Grants account. We have free AdWords money to
spend. How about a campaign targetting Women Outreach program? (Thanks to
Paul Cutler for suggesting this!)

What we need is an ad and then an idea of who we are targetting, what they
are searching for and what keywords we want to target.

Ad format is:
Title: 25 characters
Line1: 35 characters
Line2: 35 characters
Line3: 35 characters

Here's what I'm thinking but I could use some help.

Ad groups would be: (We can also have more than one ad per group and compare
effectiveness.)

1. Women looking for a job
Ad: (I think there were some good points from before about what type of ads
work best ...)
Join the GNOME Community
Help make a free desktop accessible
to everyone. Join the Women's
SummerOutreach Program.

Keywords:
software intern
software internship
free software job
open source job
develop free software
develop open source
summer job software

Landing page:
http://projects.gnome.org/outreach/women/ (Or should we have a different
one.)

2. Developers and users who might support the group
Ad:
Support women in GNOME!
Encourage more women to develop
free software. Mentor or donate to the
Women's Summer Outreach Program!

Keywords:
(Not quite sure about this. What do we think users and developers will be
searching on?)
guadec
GNOME 3
free software movement
women free software
women gnome
girls free software
women open source
girls open source

Landing page:
http://projects.gnome.org/outreach/women/

Thoughts? Ideas?

Stormy

I got the ad format slightly wrong.

Title: 25 characters
Line1: 35 characters
Line2: 35 characters
Line3: URL

I quickly changed them to this but could use suggestions: (URL actually goes
to http://projects.gnome.org/outreach/women. I could replace outreach with
women.)
