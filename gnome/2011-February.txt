Outreach Program for Women

by: Marina Zhurakhinskaya

The GNOME project proudly announced eight Outreach Program for Women intern=
s on November 5 in the following press release: http://www.gnome.org/press/=
releases/2010-11-women-outreach-interns.html . We were able to accept eight=
 strong candidates thanks to Google sponsoring four of them, the GNOME Foun=
dation sponsoring three, and Collabora sponsoring one. The participants, as=
 well as their location, project, and mentor, are:

  * Tiffany Antopolski, Toronto, Canada - Documentation - Paul Cutler
  * Nanci de Brito Bonfim, Salvador, Brazil - Anjuta - S=C3=A9bastien Granj=
oux
  * Luciana Fujii Pontello, Belo Horizonte, Brazil - Cheese - Thiago Sousa =
Santos
  * Eugenia Gabrielova, Chicago, USA - Anjuta - Johannes Schmid
  * Laura Elisa Lucas Alday, Buenos Aires, Argentina - Cheese - Daniel Sieg=
el
  * Hellyna Ng, Johor, Malaysia / Singapore - GNOME Shell - Marina Zhurakhi=
nskaya
  * Natalia Andrea Ruz Leiva, Valpara=C3=ADso, Chile - Documentation - Paul=
 Cutler
  * Chandni Verma, Lucknow, India - Empathy - Danielle Madeley

The following blog post has more information about each participant as well=
 as the links to their individual blogs: http://blogs.gnome.org/marina/2010=
/11/05/meet-the-gnome-outreach-program-for-women-interns The participants h=
ave started their internships on December 15 and have been updating the GNO=
ME community about their work with frequent blog posts that are aggregated =
on Planet GNOME. The internships period will end March 15. We are hoping th=
at all of the participants will stay active in the GNOME community past the=
 completion of their internships.

We are planning to run the next round of internships from end of May throug=
h end of August, with the application process announced sometime in the beg=
inning of March and the application deadline on April 8. This application d=
eadline is same as the application deadline for Google Summer of Code (GSoC=
) this year, which will allow us to direct qualifying applicants to apply f=
or both programs. GNOME has historically had few female applicants for GSoC=
, and running these programs in parallel will bring the attention of more f=
emale student coders to the opportunity to participate in GSoC. Unlike GSoC=
, GNOME Outreach Program for Women doesn=E2=80=99t require applicants to be=
 students and includes non-coding internships, such as documentation, graph=
ic design and marketing.

M=C3=A1ir=C3=ADn Duffy has completed teaching Girl Scouts=E2=80=99 Digital =
