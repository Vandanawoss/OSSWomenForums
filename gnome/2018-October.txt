Hi all,

The GNOME Foundation has confirmed funding for three spots in Outreachy for the December round! If you would like to mentor this round, please head to https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/gnome/submit-project/ as soon as possible and submit your project idea there. All project ideas need to be added in the Outreachy's application system by mentors by October 10 and approved by coordinators by October 16. Only ideas approved in the system by October 16 will be available for Outreachy this round, so even if you are working with a prospective candidate on a project idea, you have to add it by October 10 to provide enough time for the triage committee (Matthias Clasen, Allan Day, and Sriram Ramkrishna) to review it by October 16. Mentors or applicants will not be able to propose new project ideas for this round of Outreachy after that.

Because GNOME only usually has a few participants in Outreachy, we are looking to offer projects that are most strategic for GNOME. These include, but are not limited to, projects in the area of privacy, GTK+, core experience, core applications, developer experience, and development infrastructure.

Outreachy application deadline is October 30. Please also consider applying or encouraging others to apply with the help of the resources at https://www.outreachy.org/promote/ More information about GNOME's participation in Outreachy is available at https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/Outreachy

Please feel free to e-mail gnome-outreachy-list@gnome.org , which is a private mailing list with Outreachy coordinators and mentors for GNOME, with any questions.

Thanks,
Marina
