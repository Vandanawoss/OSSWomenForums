Dear hackers,

As you may know, the GNOME Foundation provides travel sponsorships to
individuals who want to attend GUADEC and need financial assistance.

We are happy to announce the Travel Committee is ready to receive
applications for sponsorships to attend to GUADEC 2012.  This year,
GUADEC is being held in the Faculty of Computer Science at the
University of A Coru=C3=B1a, in the beautiful city of A Coru=C3=B1a (Spain)=
, from
Thursday 26th July until Wednesday 1st August.

The instructions are detailed at http://live.gnome.org/Travel
Please read them carefully.

Deadline: May 16, 2012, 23:59 UTC.  You can start sending your
applications now!

Some additional comments:
      * Any information you send to the Travel Committee will be
        private.
      * Asking for sponsorship *does not* guarantee you will get
        sponsored.
      * A good application with good information will be processed
        faster.
      * If you need help with accommodation, the Travel Committee will
        handle it directly with the organization.  You should state that
        you need accommodation, and leave the cost blank.
      * Always choose the most economical option whenever possible.
        People who need travel sponsorship, should look for the best
        price (e.g. through a service like kayak.com).  If the Travel
        Committee finds a cheaper price, that will be the price
        considered during the   evaluation.
      * If you are applying to a Google Summer of Code program (as
        student or mentor) you should mention it in your application.
      * GSoC students usually get a percentage of their GUADEC expenses
        covered.
      * If you submitted an abstract to be presented at GUADEC, you
        should mention it in your application.  Preference will be given
        to people giving presentations at GUADEC.
      * The travel committee will cross check with the GUADEC paper
        committee the talks that have been accepted, so as long as you
        let us know you submitted one, there is no need to follow up.
      * The Travel committee should reply back about receiving your
        application within 2-3 days. After that we would accumulate all
        the sponsorship requests and process them together. So please do
        not panic if we take some time to reply on the status.
        Affirmative/Negative you would surely get a response.
      * If you need an invitation letter, you must clearly state your
        contributions and name at least two fellow hackers that can
        directly support your requirement.
      * No personal emails. Please keep travel-committee Cc'ed on all
        your replies.

You can find us in the #travel channel at irc.gnome.org.

Kind regards,

Dear all,

First of all, I apologize if this message is merely one of the numerous
interview requests, and you find this irrelevant to the mailing list.

I am a PhD student majoring in communication studies at Bowling Green State
University, OH. I am currently writing a dissertation on women's
experiences in Free and Open Source development. More specifically, I
examine how labor relations works in FOSS communities along the gendered
line from feminist and political economy perspectives, and how the
male-dominated environment of the communities prevents more diverse
knowledge from being produced by explicitly/implicitly excluding women.

I will be staying in San Francisco from May 24th to June 22nd to interview
women in FOSS development. I wonder if any of you would be interested in
participating in an interview. I assume that all of you must be busy for
various projects, but your participation would be a great contribution to
my field where discussions on free culture are increasingly important. I
want my dissertation project to reflect the female participants' nuanced
thoughts and experiences by meeting them in person rather than relying on
numbers or short answers. I sincerely hope some of you can take some time
to share your knowledge as an open source advocate.

If you have any questions about my project or me. You can email me at
either hysterogenic@gmail.com or oyeonj@bgsu.edu. Or you can visit my blog
that I created for introducing my research and myself (
http://fcodeofethics.wordpress.com/<https://mail.bgsu.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=11c70b91e65a4fc5819a2e79d049d54a&URL=http%3a%2f%2ffcodeofethics.wordpress.com%2f>).
You can share this email on other forum as you like.

Hello all,
why some people have two nicknames in IRC?
One for when they are online, and one for when they are away from keyboards?
What's the purpose of the second?

Thanks,

Hi Anna,

Can you give an example? Sometimes my name appears differently because my
chat program crashes, and when I log back in and my old connection is still
active. When that happens the program appends a number to the end of my
nick. When I am logged into more than one IRC service (like irc.gimp.organd
irc.gnome.org) then the same thing happens. Sometimes people set their name
to something slightly different when they are away (like Anna_away or
Anna_afk).

Does that answer your question or were you thinking of something different?

Meg

Hi Meg,
I was referring to you last example, when someone uses:
Anna-away or Anna-afk.
Also, I am  using Empathy and I haven't seen any setting for when away
(besides custom message).
I guess people may be using different applications ...


Thanks,
             Anna

Hi Anna,

People manually change their nick when stepping away from the computer, so that other people who might want to talk to them know that they are not actually around. "afk" stands for "away from keyboard". People prefer not to sign off from IRC so that they can still see the log of what was said in various channels or who pinged them with a private message when they come back.

Does this answer your question?

Marina

Yes,
thanks.  So it is manual and the reason is to "log" what is going on in IRC

Hello All,

The GNOME Foundation provides travel sponsorships to individuals who want
to attend GNOME.Asia 2012 and need financial assistance.

GNOME.Asia, 2012 is being held in City University of Hong Kong (
http://2012.gnome.asia/location/), from Friday 8th June, until Sunday 10th
June.

The instructions are detailed at http://live.gnome.org/Travel
Please read them carefully.

How to apply for sponsorship
(Things to keep in mind during the process)

   - Be patient, we are volunteers
   - If it's taking too long and you see prices could significantly raise
   -or something similar- please ping a member of the committee.
   - DO NOT BUY ANYTHING UNTIL YOU GET A VERY CLEAR CONFIRMATION, applying
   does not mean you are approved, and silence does not mean approval.
   - Try to get the best fares for tickets and lodging, look at various
   airlines and routes and try to avoid agencies since they usually charge 10%
   or 20% extra in every ticket. (Sites like Kayak can help find reasonable
   fares.)
   - Please find a roommate to save on lodging costs where possible.
   - Ask for only what you need. If you can afford to pay for some of your
   ticket or lodging, we would really appreciate it as that means we can help
   more people.
   - Be responsible, the money you save is the money we will use to fund
   someone else or even yourself again.


The process

   - First, make sure the conference or event is relevant for GNOME. If
   it's not an announced one like GNOME.Asia or a Hackfest, please explain us
   why would you like to go and what are the benefits you think we would all
   get from your presence there (promotion, contacts, etc)
   - Now, fill the application form form with the relevant information. (
   https://live.gnome.org/Travel?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=gnome_travel_subsidy.odt
   )
   - Send the filled form to travel-committee@gnome.org, this is a private
   list that will be visible only to the Travel Committee members and possibly
   GNOME's Board of Directors
   - Wait patiently to get questions or suggestions about your request
   - Expect a confirmation of your approval soon, or if it's taking too
   long, feel free to ask in IRC to any member of the committee
   - Now that you GOT COMPLETE CONFIRMATION buy your tickets and/or make
   your reservation
   - After the event, you have 2 weeks to mail us the appropriate receipts
   for tickets, lodging, etc; if they are not in English or the receipt has a
   lot of information, please clearly mark the total and the purpose.
   - Your reimbursement will be ready no more than 4 weeks after the
   receipts deadline


You can find us in the #travel channel at irc.gnome.org

Regards,
Bharath
