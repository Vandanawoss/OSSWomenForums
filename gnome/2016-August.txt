Hi, 

The seventh annual GNOME women's dinner will happen on Saturday, August 13th during GUADEC. If you would like to attend, please add your name at https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/Events/DinnerAugust2016 so that we can ensure we have an appropriately-sized table at the restaurant. Please feel free to share the information about the dinner with women and genderqueer people you know attending GUADEC who may not be on this list.

Thanks,
Marina
